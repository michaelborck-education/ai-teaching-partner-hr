# AI in HR Education: One-Hour Faculty Workshop

**Focus: Simple prompts → powerful teaching outcomes**  
**Audience: HR lecturers (low-tech, smart, practical)**  
**Goal: Show potential without overwhelming**

## 🎯 Opening Hook (5 minutes)

**"What if your students could practice HR scenarios infinitely, with instant feedback?"**

- No coding required
- No software installation  
- Just plain English instructions
- Start small, scale gradually

## 💡 The Core Concept: Chat Interface as Teaching Tool (10 minutes)

### Traditional vs. AI-Enhanced

| Traditional Approach | AI-Enhanced Approach |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| Case study (read once) | Conversation simulation (practice repeatedly) |
| Group discussion (limited participation) | Individual role-play (everyone practices) |
| Written assignment (delayed feedback) | Immediate AI feedback |

### Why Chat Interface Works
- **Zero learning curve** - Everyone can use a website
- **Process over product** - Focus on thinking, not final answer
- **Engagement through interaction** - Active vs. passive learning
