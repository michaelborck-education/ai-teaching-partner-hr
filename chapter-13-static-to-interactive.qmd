# Chapter 13: From Static to Interactive - AI-Powered Activity Transformation

## The Challenge: Static Documents Don't Engage

You have a well-designed case study in Word or PDF. Students read it, maybe discuss it, then move on. The learning moment is brief and passive.

**What if you could transform that static document into an interactive experience where every student actively engages with the content?**

---

## The Solution: AI-Generated Interactive HTML

### What It Looks Like
- **Interactive case studies** with input fields for student responses
- **Decision trees** where choices lead to different outcomes  
- **Reflection prompts** with saveable responses
- **Self-assessment checklists** with immediate feedback
- **Scenario simulations** with branching paths

### Why HTML?
- **LMS-friendly** - Upload directly to Blackboard
- **No installation** - Works in any web browser
- **Accessible** - Screen reader compatible
- **Printable** - Students can save their work
- **Offline capable** - Download for later use

---

## 🛠️ The Transformation Process

### Step 1: Prepare Your Static Content
1. **Identify the document** (case study, worksheet, activity guide)
2. **Locate interaction points** (questions, decisions, reflections)
3. **Mark enhancement opportunities** (where could students input/respond?)

### Step 2: Use AI to Generate Interactive HTML

#### **Prompt Template for Basic Transformation**
```
Transform this static [document type] into an interactive HTML webpage:

[Paste your document content here]

Create:
1. Professional HTML structure with CSS styling
2. Input fields for each question/reflection point
3. Save/print functionality for student responses
4. Professional appearance suitable for university students
5. Mobile-responsive design

Requirements:
- All CSS embedded (no external files)
- JavaScript for save/print functionality
- Clear instructions for students
- Professional academic styling
- Form validation where appropriate

Output: Complete HTML file that can be uploaded directly to Blackboard.
```

#### **Advanced Prompt for Scenario-Based Activities**
```
Create an interactive HTML simulation based on this HR scenario:

[Paste your case study/scenario]

Features needed:
1. Branching decision tree - student choices affect outcomes
2. Progress tracking - show completion status
3. Feedback system - provide guidance for each choice
4. Score/assessment summary at the end
5. Reset functionality to retry scenarios
6. Print/save complete simulation with responses

Technical requirements:
- Single HTML file (embedded CSS/JavaScript)
- Professional university styling
- Mobile-responsive design
- Accessible form elements
- Local storage for saving progress

Make it engaging but academically rigorous.
```

- **Reflection prompts** after each decision
- **Complete transcript** for submission

### Before: Worksheet
> "Complete the performance review template..."

### After: Interactive Form
- **Guided input** with help text
- **Real-time validation** 
- **Example responses** for guidance
- **Save progress** functionality
- **Print-ready format**
