# Alignment with Curtin University Learning Outcomes

## Purpose of This Appendix

This appendix demonstrates how AI integration in multidisciplinary business education directly supports—rather than replaces—existing learning outcomes from Curtin University's business programs. It's designed for:

- Business faculty across disciplines (HR, Marketing, Accounting, Management, Tourism & Hospitality, Supply Chain, Information Systems, Economics) seeking institutional justification for AI integration
- Program coordinators evaluating pedagogical innovations
- Academic administrators assessing alignment with university strategy
- Accreditation reviews demonstrating innovative teaching aligned with standards

---

## Curtin University Strategic Context

**From the source material:**

Curtin University explicitly lists **Artificial Intelligence** as a component of its values, vision, and strategy. This provides strong institutional foundation for integrating AI into teaching and learning.

The university's commitment to innovation and technological advancement means that AI integration in HR education is not only permitted but aligned with strategic priorities.

## Business Programs at Curtin University

This appendix uses HR programs as the primary example, but the learning outcome alignment framework applies to ALL business programs at Curtin, including:

- **Business & Marketing programs** (undergraduate and postgraduate)
- **Accounting & Finance programs** (undergraduate and postgraduate)
- **Management & Organisational Studies programs** (undergraduate and postgraduate)
- **Tourism & Hospitality Management programs** (undergraduate and postgraduate)
- **Supply Chain & Logistics programs** (undergraduate and postgraduate)
- **Information Systems & Technology programs** (undergraduate and postgraduate)
- **Economics programs** (undergraduate and postgraduate)

Each program has its own learning outcomes framework, and AI applications support learning outcomes across all disciplines in similar ways.

**Note:** To adapt this appendix for your specific program, substitute your program's learning outcomes where HR outcomes are referenced, and apply the same alignment logic using examples from your discipline.

## Core Learning Outcome 1: Apply Discipline-Specific Theory to Evidence-Based Practice

### Curtin Expectation:
Students must demonstrate ability to apply discipline-specific theories (psychological, organisational, business, technical, etc.) to real-world situations and make evidence-based decisions.

*Example context (HR): Students must demonstrate ability to apply psychological and organisational theories to real-world HR situations and make evidence-based decisions.*

### How AI Integration Supports This:

| AI Application (Chapter) | How It Supports Theory Application |
|---|---|
| **Conversation Simulations (Chapter 4)** | Students must apply motivational theory, conflict resolution models, and organisational justice principles *in real-time* during dynamic conversations. AI persona responds to theoretical applications, showing immediate consequences. |
| **Evidence-Based Strategic Intervention (Chapter 7, Model 2)** | Students use AI to analyse mock HR data, then must justify recommendations using theory. Assessment requires explicit connection between data patterns and theoretical frameworks (equity theory, two-factor theory, etc.). |
| **Debating Technique (Chapter 3)** | Multi-perspective analysis requires students to evaluate competing HR strategies through theoretical lenses and identify which theories best explain stakeholder positions. |

### Evidence of Learning:
- Students cite specific theories in conversation transcripts
- Students critique AI recommendations by identifying missing theoretical considerations
- Students demonstrate application, not just definition, of theory

---

## Core Learning Outcome 2: Knowledge of Relevant Legislative and Legal Rules

### Curtin Expectation:
Students must demonstrate understanding and application of employment law, workplace health and safety legislation, Fair Work Act, and anti-discrimination principles.

### How AI Integration Supports This:

| AI Application (Chapter) | How It Supports Legal Application |
|---|---|
| **Conversation Simulations (Chapter 4)** | Scenarios embed legal considerations (procedural fairness, natural justice, privacy law). Students must demonstrate compliance in real-time. AI personas can reference or challenge legal issues. |
| **Process Audit Assessment (Chapter 7, Model 1)** | Students must identify where they did/didn't apply legal principles during conversations and cite specific legislation. Self-audit forces explicit legal reasoning. |
| **Ethical Analysis Exercises (Appendix A, Section 5)** | Students evaluate AI-generated policies and identify legal flaws, discriminatory provisions, and compliance gaps. Must explain *why* something is legally problematic. |

### Evidence of Learning:
- Transcripts show students applying legal principles in decision-making
- Process audits include citations to Fair Work Act, WHS legislation, etc.
- Students identify when AI recommendations violate legal requirements

---

## Core Learning Outcome 3: Demonstrate Effective Communication and Empathetic Practices

### Curtin Expectation:
Students must communicate effectively with individuals and groups, demonstrate empathy, and manage difficult interpersonal situations professionally.

### How AI Integration Supports This:

| AI Application (Chapter) | How It Supports Communication Skills |
|---|---|
| **Conversation Simulations (Chapter 4)** | Every simulation requires students to practice active listening, empathetic responses, and professional communication. AI responds dynamically to communication quality—empathy unlocks information, poor communication causes resistance. |
| **Multiple Practice Cycles** | Unlike traditional role-play (one attempt), students can practice the same conversation multiple times, refining communication approach each time. Develops fluency and confidence. |
| **AI Critique of Communication (Chapter 4, Phase 3)** | Detailed feedback on tone, word choice, questioning technique, and empathy demonstration. Students receive specific quotes showing effective/ineffective communication. |

### Evidence of Learning:
- Transcripts demonstrate professional tone, active listening, appropriate empathy
- Students show improvement between first and revised conversation attempts
- Reflections articulate understanding of communication impact

---

## Core Learning Outcome 4: Apply Professional Skills in an Ethical Manner

### Curtin Expectation:
Students must demonstrate understanding and respect for human rights, cultural diversity, and ethical professional conduct in all HR activities.

### How AI Integration Supports This:

| AI Application (Chapter) | How It Supports Ethical Practice |
|---|---|
| **Transparency Model (Chapter 5)** | Teaching students to use AI openly and critically models professional integrity. Students learn to acknowledge sources, verify information, and maintain accountability. |
| **AI Ethics Scenarios (Chapter 9)** | Students analyse ethical problems with AI use in HR (biased screening tools, algorithmic discrimination, accountability questions). Develops ethical reasoning about technology in professional practice. |
| **Critique and Override Exercises (Chapter 7, Model 3)** | Students must identify when AI recommendations are ethically problematic and demonstrate superior human judgment. Cannot delegate ethical responsibility to technology. |

### Evidence of Learning:
- Students identify bias, discrimination, or ethical flaws in AI outputs
- Students demonstrate human oversight of AI-generated decisions
- Reflections show awareness of professional accountability

---

## Core Learning Outcome 5: Utilise Critical Thinking Skills to Evaluate and Integrate Information

### Curtin Expectation:
Students must critically analyse problems, evaluate information from multiple sources, and make evidence-based decisions on HR issues.

### How AI Integration Supports This:

| AI Application (Chapter) | How It Supports Critical Thinking |
|---|---|
| **Pros and Cons Technique (Chapter 3)** | Students evaluate AI-generated analysis of multiple HR approaches, then must critique AI's reasoning and add missing considerations. Requires going beyond AI's thinking. |
| **Self-Assessment Tool (Chapter 5)** | Students receive AI feedback, but must critically evaluate whether feedback is correct. Strong students challenge AI's assessment and justify their position. |
| **Evidence-Based Strategic Intervention (Chapter 7, Model 2)** | Students must identify what AI got wrong in data analysis or recommendations. Demonstrates critical evaluation, not blind acceptance of technology. |

### Evidence of Learning:
- Students successfully identify AI errors or limitations
- Students improve AI recommendations with additional analysis
- Students demonstrate reasoning that surpasses AI capability

---

## Core Learning Outcome 6: Ability for Self-Directed Learning and Reflective Practice

### Curtin Expectation:
Students must demonstrate capacity for independent learning, reflection on practice, and continuous professional development.

### How AI Integration Supports This:

| AI Application (Chapter) | How It Supports Self-Directed Learning |
|---|---|
| **Self-Assessment Tool (Chapter 5)** | Students drive their own improvement cycle: draft → AI feedback → reflection → revision. Takes ownership of learning process without waiting for lecturer feedback. |
| **Process Audit (Chapter 7, Model 1)** | Students analyse their own performance, identify strengths/weaknesses, and propose improvements. Develops metacognitive awareness essential for professional growth. |
| **Unlimited Practice** | AI simulations available 24/7. Students who want additional practice can self-direct their learning beyond required assignments. |

### Evidence of Learning:
- Reflections demonstrate genuine self-assessment (identifying own mistakes)
- Evidence of revision between drafts shows iterative improvement
- Students articulate what they learned and how they'll apply it

---

## Core Learning Outcome 7: Demonstrate Technological Proficiency in HR Management Contexts

## Addressing Potential Institutional Concerns

### Concern: "Does AI integration compromise academic standards?"

**Response:**

AI integration in this booklet **raises academic standards** by:
- Shifting assessment from knowledge recall to applied professional competence
- Providing unlimited practice opportunities that traditional methods can't scale
- Requiring higher-order thinking (critique, evaluation, judgment) rather than memorization
- Making professional process visible and assessable through transcripts and audits

Students cannot succeed simply by having AI generate answers—they must demonstrate process, justify decisions, critique AI outputs, and show genuine understanding.

### Concern: "How does this align with academic integrity policies?"

**Response:**

The transparency model (Chapter 5, Chapter 9) aligns with academic integrity principles by:
- Making AI use explicit and expected (not hidden)
- Requiring critical engagement with AI outputs (not passive acceptance)
- Assessing students' thinking process (not just final products)
- Teaching professional ethics around technology use

This approach prepares students for professional practice where AI use is normal and expected, but accountability remains with the human professional.

### Concern: "What evidence supports this pedagogical approach?"

**Response:**

This approach is grounded in:
- **Experiential learning theory**: Students learn by doing, not just reading
- **Deliberate practice**: Multiple repetitions with feedback improve skill development
- **Reflective practice**: Self-assessment and metacognition enhance professional development
- **Authentic assessment**: Evaluating performance in realistic contexts predicts professional capability

AI enables scaling of pedagogical best practices that were previously limited by lecturer time and resources.
