# Chapter 2: Getting Started - Your First AI Conversation

## What You'll Do in This Chapter

In the next 15 minutes, you're going to have your first productive conversation with an AI tool. By the end of this chapter, you'll understand:

- How to access free AI tools (no installation required)
- What a "prompt" actually is
- How to write clear instructions that get useful results
- The difference between a weak prompt and a powerful one
- How to think about AI as a teaching assistant, not a magic oracle

Let's jump straight in.

## Step 1: Accessing an AI Tool

You have several free options. I recommend starting with one of these two:

### Option A: ChatGPT (by OpenAI)
1. Go to **chat.openai.com** in any web browser
2. Create a free account (takes 2 minutes)
3. You'll see a simple text box at the bottom of the screen
4. That's it—you're ready to go

### Option B: Claude (by Anthropic)
1. Go to **claude.ai** in any web browser
2. Create a free account
3. Same interface—a clean text box waiting for your instructions

Both work essentially the same way. For this booklet, examples will work with either tool. Choose whichever interface you prefer.

**Note:** You don't need to download anything, install software, or configure settings. It's as simple as using Google—type something in, get a response back.

## Step 2: Understanding Prompts

A **prompt** is simply the instruction or question you type into the AI tool. Think of it like briefing a very capable research assistant who:

- Has read an enormous amount of material on nearly every subject
- Can generate text, analyse situations, and role-play scenarios
- Follows your instructions literally (which is both powerful and requires precision)
- Doesn't have opinions, emotions, or genuine understanding—just pattern recognition

The quality of what you get back depends almost entirely on the quality of your prompt.

Let's see this in action.

## Your First Prompt: The Weak Version

Open your chosen AI tool and type this exactly:

```
Write a case study about HR.
```

Hit enter and see what you get.

You'll probably receive something generic—maybe a story about employee conflict or a hiring scenario. It's *fine*, but it's not particularly useful for your specific teaching needs.

**Why was this weak?** Because the prompt was vague. "HR" covers everything from payroll to industrial relations. "A case study" could be 100 words or 5,000 words. The AI had to guess what you wanted.

## Your Second Prompt: The Powerful Version

Now try this. Copy and paste this entire prompt:

```
You are an expert lecturer in Human Resource Management at a university level.

I need you to create a case study for my undergraduate students that will help them practice applying employment law to a workplace conflict.

Here are the requirements:
- The scenario should involve a performance management issue where the employee claims the process was unfair
- Include enough detail that students need to identify which legal principles apply
- The scenario should be 300-400 words
- End with three discussion questions that require students to analyse whether the employer followed procedural fairness

Begin.
```

Hit enter.

**Notice the difference?** The AI now knows:
- What role to adopt (expert HR lecturer)
- Who the audience is (undergraduate students)
- What specific learning objective you're targeting (applying employment law)
- What the scenario should contain (performance management + fairness claims)
- How long it should be (300-400 words)
- What format you want (scenario + three discussion questions)

The output should be dramatically more useful. It's tailored, specific, and ready to use in your class (with your refinement, of course).

## The Anatomy of a Good Prompt

Let's break down what made that second prompt powerful:

### 1. **Set the Role**
> "You are an expert lecturer in Human Resource Management..."

This tells the AI what perspective to adopt. You could also say:
- "You are an experienced HR Business Partner coaching a new manager"
- "You are a union representative negotiating with management"
- "You are a frustrated employee who believes they've been unfairly treated"

The role shapes the tone, vocabulary, and approach of the response.

### 2. **Define the Context and Audience**
> "I need you to create a case study for my undergraduate students..."

Who is this for? What's the purpose? This prevents the AI from pitching the content at the wrong level (too simple for postgrads, too complex for first-years).

### 3. **Specify the Task Clearly**
> "...that will help them practice applying employment law to a workplace conflict."

What exactly do you want? Don't just say "write something about employment law." Say what the student should *do* with it.

### 4. **Provide Constraints and Requirements**
> "The scenario should involve..." "Include enough detail..." "300-400 words..." "End with three discussion questions..."

These boundaries guide the AI and prevent it from going off in unhelpful directions. Think of constraints as guardrails.

### 5. **Give a Clear Start Signal**
> "Begin."

This tells the AI to execute the task now. Simple, but effective.

## Practice Exercise: Your Turn

Now it's your turn to write a prompt from scratch. Think of something you currently teach in your HR course—a topic where you wish you had more practice materials or better scenarios.

Use this template:

```
You are [define the role].

I need you to [state the specific task] for [define your audience].

Here are the requirements:
- [Requirement 1]
- [Requirement 2]
- [Requirement 3]

[Any additional context or constraints]

Begin.
```

**Example topics to try:**
- Generate interview questions for a recruitment consultant role
- Create a dialogue showing poor conflict resolution that students must critique
- Draft a policy outline for flexible work arrangements with deliberate gaps students must identify
- Write a performance review conversation that contains multiple communication errors

Type your prompt into the AI tool and see what happens.

## What to Expect (and Not Expect)

As you experiment, keep these realities in mind:

### What AI Does Well:
- Generates diverse scenarios and examples quickly
- Creates consistent, well-structured text
- Role-plays different perspectives convincingly
- Provides frameworks and outlines
- Analyzes text against criteria you define

### What AI Doesn't Do:
- Understand context the way humans do
- Have actual expertise or professional judgment
- Know your specific students, university policies, or local employment laws
- Guarantee factual accuracy (it can confidently state incorrect information)
- Replace your pedagogical design or assessment judgment

**The golden rule:** AI is a powerful draft generator and practice partner. You are still the expert who evaluates, refines, and ensures accuracy.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

**"The AI gave me something too simple/complex."**
→ Add to your prompt: "Pitch this at the level of a third-year undergraduate student" or "This is for students who already understand basic employment law."

**"The response was too short/long."**
→ Specify word count or structure: "Provide 500 words" or "Write exactly 5 paragraphs."

**"It's too generic—not specific to Australia/my context."**
→ Add context: "Set this scenario in an Australian workplace context, referencing the Fair Work Act" or "The company is based in Perth, Western Australia."

**"The AI ignored part of my prompt."**
→ This happens sometimes. Just follow up: "Please revise that to include [the missing element]."

**"I want to change just one part."**
→ You can have a conversation: "Keep everything the same, but make the employee more defensive in tone" or "Add a section about cultural considerations."

## Your First Win

If you've followed along, you've just:
1. Accessed an AI tool
2. Written a structured prompt
3. Generated a teaching resource you didn't have 5 minutes ago

That's not a small thing. You've learned the fundamental skill that everything else in this booklet builds on.

## Before You Move On

Try this homework before Chapter 3:

**Experiment with three different prompts:**
1. One that generates content for your students (a case study, a scenario, a set of questions)
2. One that asks the AI to role-play someone (an angry employee, a nervous manager, a compliance officer)
3. One that asks the AI to analyse or critique something (feed it a sample student response or a policy and ask it to evaluate against specific criteria)

Get comfortable with the basic rhythm: prompt → response → refine → use.

The more you practice, the more natural it becomes. And the more specific your prompts, the more useful your outputs.

**Next Chapter Preview:** In Chapter 3, you'll learn five specific prompting techniques that are perfectly suited to HR education. Each one is designed to develop a different critical thinking skill in your students: scoping problems, evaluating options, following processes, practicing conversations, and debating ethical positions. These aren't just "AI tricks"—they're pedagogical strategies that AI makes scalable.
