## About This Booklet

This booklet is designed for business educators who want to enhance their teaching with Artificial Intelligence but don't consider themselves "tech people."

You won't need to code, install complex software, or understand how AI works technically. What you will learn is how to use simple, plain-language instructions (called "prompts") to create powerful learning experiences for your students.

### Who This Is For

- Business educators at Curtin University teaching undergraduate or postgraduate students across disciplines like HR, Marketing, Accounting, Business Analytics, Tourism & Hospitality, Information Systems, and Management
- Academics interested in innovative pedagogy for professional education
- Unit coordinators exploring AI integration aligned with learning outcomes
- Research supervisors supporting MCom and other postgraduate students
- Anyone curious about practical, non-technical AI applications in education

### What You Won't Find Here

- Technical AI theory or computer science concepts
- Coding or programming requirements
- Abstract discussions about AI's future
- Complex software installation guides
- "One size fits all" solutions

### What You Will Find Here

- **Concrete examples**: Every chapter includes ready-to-use prompts and scenarios, with discipline-specific adaptations for HR, Marketing, Accounting, Business Analytics, Tourism & Hospitality, Information Systems, and Management
- **Practical guidance**: Step-by-step implementation for busy lecturers
- **Real pedagogical value**: AI applications directly support existing learning outcomes
- **Honest assessment**: What AI does well, what it doesn't, and what requires human judgment
- **Ethical frameworks**: How to integrate AI responsibly and teach students to do the same

## How to Use This Booklet

### If you're completely new to AI:
Start with **Chapter 1** (motivation) and **Chapter 2** (your first AI conversation). Work through the basics before exploring advanced applications.

### If you're ready to experiment:
Jump to **Chapter 3** (six essential techniques) and pick one to try immediately. Refer to **Appendix A** for copy-paste prompts.

### If you're designing assessments:
Read **Chapter 7** (process-based assessment models) and **Chapter 10** (complete unit design). Use these frameworks to redesign existing assignments.

### If you teach postgraduate students:
Focus on **Chapter 11** (AI as research assistant) for guidance on appropriate AI use in research contexts.

### If you're presenting to colleagues:
Use **Appendix B** (one-hour faculty workshop guide) as a facilitation template.

### If you need institutional justification:
Refer to **Appendix C** (alignment with Curtin learning outcomes) to demonstrate how AI integration supports existing educational goals.

## The Core Philosophy

Three principles underpin everything in this booklet:

**1. AI as Scaffolding, Not Replacement**

You are the expert educator. AI is a tool that helps you scale what you already know works—personalized practice, immediate feedback, realistic simulations. AI builds the framework quickly; you ensure it's pedagogically sound and academically rigorous.

**2. Transparency Over Prohibition**

Rather than trying to prevent AI use (impossible and counterproductive), we teach students to use AI openly, critically, and ethically. This prepares them for professional HR practice where AI tools are standard.

**3. Start Small, Scale Gradually**

You don't need to revolutionize your entire curriculum overnight. Start with one prompt, one assignment, one semester. Build confidence and capability progressively.

## Acknowledgments

This booklet synthesizes ideas from multiple sources:

- Prompt engineering techniques adapted for professional education contexts
- Curtin University program information and learning outcomes across business disciplines
- Pedagogical frameworks from experiential learning, reflective practice, and authentic assessment
- Professional practice standards and ethical guidelines across business fields
- Emerging research on AI in higher education

AI tools were used in the initial drafting of this document. All content has been reviewed and edited by the author for accuracy and pedagogical appropriateness.

The goal is not to be cutting-edge or technically impressive. The goal is to help business educators do their work better—prepare confident, competent, ethical professionals for complex workplaces.

## Important Notes

### Technology Changes Rapidly

AI tools evolve quickly. Specific platform names (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) and capabilities described here reflect the state of technology in early 2025. The principles and pedagogical approaches remain relevant even as specific tools change.

### Context Matters

This booklet was developed for Curtin University's business programs, with HR serving as the primary example discipline. If you're at a different institution or teaching a different business discipline, you'll need to adapt examples, learning outcomes, and institutional references. The frameworks are transferable; the specifics may not be.

### This Is a Starting Point

Consider this booklet a foundation, not a complete solution. You'll discover what works for your students, your teaching style, and your context through experimentation. The appendices provide templates you can adapt and build upon.

## Getting Help and Providing Feedback

As you implement ideas from this booklet, you may have questions, encounter challenges, or discover innovative applications we didn't consider.

**For Curtin staff:**
- Contact your Faculty Teaching and Learning team for pedagogical support
- Consult with IT Services for technical access and troubleshooting
- Connect with colleagues who are experimenting with AI integration
- Consider forming a learning community around AI-enhanced teaching

**For others:**
- Adapt frameworks to your institutional and disciplinary context
- Share successes and failures with your teaching and learning community
- Contribute to the growing body of practice around AI in education

## A Personal Note to Readers

If you're feeling skeptical about AI in education, that's healthy. Technology is not inherently good or bad—it's how we use it that matters.

If you're worried this is too technical, I promise it's not. If you can write an email, you can write an AI prompt.

If you're concerned about losing control of your teaching, you won't. You'll gain new capabilities while maintaining your pedagogical judgment and professional expertise.

The goal of this booklet is simple: **by the end, you should feel excited and equipped to try one new thing in your next class.**

That's it. One simulation. One new assessment approach. One conversation where a student gets to practice being an HR professional in a safe environment before they face real workplace challenges.

Because ultimately, that's what we're here for.

Let's begin.
