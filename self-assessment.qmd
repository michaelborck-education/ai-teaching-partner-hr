# AI as Study Buddy - Self-Assessment Tool

## The Academic Integrity Challenge

Let's address the elephant in the room: you're worried students will use AI to cheat.

That's a legitimate concern. Students could paste assignment questions into ChatGPT, get answers, and submit them as their own work. Many universities have responded by trying to detect AI-generated text, banning AI tools, or designing "AI-proof" assessments.

**This chapter proposes a radically different approach: Give students the AI tools openly, teach them to use AI ethically, and grade them on their ability to critically improve AI outputs.**

Why? Because in their professional HR careers, they *will* use AI tools. Our job isn't to prevent that—it's to ensure they use them responsibly, understand their limitations, and maintain human judgment on critical matters.

## The Transparency Model

Here's the core idea:

**Give students BOTH:**
1. **The grading rubric** (what you'll assess them on)
2. **The exact AI critique prompt** (the tool to check their work)

This transforms AI from a cheating shortcut into a **transparent learning tool**—like giving students the answer key to practice problems before the real exam.

### The Psychology Behind It

When you give students the rubric and the AI critique tool:
- They can practice and get immediate feedback before submission
- They learn to evaluate their own work against professional standards
- They develop **metacognitive skills** (thinking about their thinking)
- They take ownership of their learning (self-directed improvement)
- The focus shifts from "fooling the teacher" to "meeting the standard"

This is pedagogically powerful for HR education because **reflective practice** and **self-directed learning** are core competencies in the field.

## How It Works: A Step-by-Step Example

### Scenario: A Written HR Case Analysis Assignment

**The Assignment:**
Students must analyse a workplace conflict scenario and recommend an appropriate HR intervention, justifying their recommendation with employment law and psychological theory.

**Traditional Approach:**
- Give students the case
- They write their analysis
- You grade it (hopefully they didn't just ask ChatGPT to write it)
- They get a grade 2 weeks later with minimal feedback

**Transparency Approach:**
- Give students the case
- Give them the detailed rubric showing exactly what you're assessing
- Give them the AI critique prompt they can use to check their draft
- They write, self-assess using the AI, revise based on feedback, and submit
- You grade the final submission (and can see evidence of their revision process)

Let's see this in action.

## Complete Worked Example

### Step 1: The Assignment Prompt

```
ASSIGNMENT: Workplace Conflict Analysis

Read the following scenario:

Maria, a team leader in the marketing department, has filed a formal
complaint alleging that her manager, David, has created a hostile work
environment. Maria claims that David regularly dismisses her ideas in
meetings, assigns her the least desirable projects, and has denied her
professional development opportunities that he's offered to other team
leaders. David denies these allegations and states that Maria is
"oversensitive" and "not a team player." There have been no previous
formal complaints, but two other team members have informally mentioned
that they find David's management style "difficult."

YOUR TASK:
Write a 750-word analysis that includes:

1. Identification of the key HR issues in this scenario (legal, ethical,
   and interpersonal)
2. An evaluation of what information you would need to gather to
   investigate this properly
3. A recommended HR intervention with justification based on:
   - Relevant employment law or workplace policy principles
   - Psychological theory (e.g., conflict resolution, motivation,
     organisational justice)
4. Potential risks if the situation is not handled appropriately

Your analysis will be assessed using the rubric provided below.
```

### Step 2: The Grading Rubric (Given to Students)

| Criterion | Excellent (4) | Good (3) | Adequate (2) | Poor (1) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Issue Identification** | Identifies all major legal, ethical, and interpersonal issues with nuanced understanding | Identifies most major issues with reasonable understanding | Identifies some issues but misses key elements or lacks depth | Fails to identify critical issues or shows misunderstanding |
| **Investigation Process** | Demonstrates comprehensive understanding of fair investigative process; identifies all relevant information needed | Shows good understanding of investigation requirements; identifies most relevant information | Shows basic understanding but missing important investigative steps | Little evidence of understanding proper investigation process |
| **Legal/Policy Application** | Accurately applies relevant law/policy with sophisticated understanding of implications | Correctly applies relevant law/policy with good understanding | Applies some relevant law/policy but with gaps or minor errors | Fails to apply relevant law/policy or shows significant misunderstanding |
| **Theoretical Integration** | Expertly integrates psychological theory to justify recommendations; makes sophisticated connections | Effectively uses theory to support recommendations; makes clear connections | Attempts to use theory but connections are superficial or underdeveloped | Minimal or no use of theory, or theory is incorrectly applied |
| **Risk Analysis** | Identifies multiple realistic risks with sophisticated understanding of consequences | Identifies key risks with good understanding of consequences | Identifies some risks but analysis is basic or incomplete | Fails to identify realistic risks or shows poor understanding |
| **Writing Quality** | Clear, professional, well-structured with no errors | Mostly clear and professional with minor issues | Adequate but has clarity or structural issues | Poor writing quality that impedes understanding |

**Total: /24**

### Step 3: The AI Self-Assessment Prompt (Given to Students)

This is what students use to check their work *before* submission.

```
You are an expert HR lecturer providing formative feedback to a student on
their assignment draft. Your role is to provide constructive, specific
feedback that helps the student improve their work before final submission.

You should be rigorous but supportive—your goal is to help them learn, not
to simply validate their work.

ASSESSMENT CRITERIA:
Evaluate the student's response against these criteria:
1. Issue Identification: Have they identified the key legal, ethical, and
   interpersonal issues?
2. Investigation Process: Do they demonstrate understanding of fair,
   thorough investigation?
3. Legal/Policy Application: Have they correctly applied relevant
   employment law or policy?
4. Theoretical Integration: Have they used psychological theory to justify
   their recommendations?
5. Risk Analysis: Have they identified realistic risks if the issue isn't
   handled well?
6. Writing Quality: Is it clear, professional, and well-structured?

YOUR TASK:
1. For each criterion, provide a score (1-4) and brief justification
2. Quote specific sentences from the student's work to illustrate your
   points
3. Identify the strongest aspect of their analysis
4. Identify the weakest aspect that needs the most improvement
5. Provide THREE specific, actionable suggestions for revision

Be honest. If something is missing, say so. If their legal analysis is
incorrect, explain why. If they've misapplied theory, guide them to the
correct application.

Here is the student's draft:

## What This Looks Like in Practice

### Student's First Draft (Excerpt)

> "This scenario shows a conflict between Maria and David. The main issue is
> that David is not being a good manager. Maria feels like she's being treated
> unfairly, which is creating a hostile work environment. This could be
> bullying or harassment. The HR department should investigate by talking to
> both Maria and David to get both sides of the story. They should also
> implement conflict resolution training for David. If this isn't handled, it
> could lead to a lawsuit or Maria quitting."

### AI Feedback (Using the Prompt Above)

**FORMATIVE FEEDBACK ON DRAFT**

**CRITERION 1: Issue Identification - Score: 2/4**

You've identified the surface-level conflict, but your analysis lacks specificity and misses critical issues.

**What you wrote:** "This could be bullying or harassment."

**The problem:** You've used these terms interchangeably, but they have different legal definitions and implications. Bullying is repeated, unreasonable behavior; harassment typically relates to discrimination based on protected characteristics (gender, race, age, etc.). Which applies here, and why? Is there evidence of discrimination based on Maria's gender or another protected characteristic, or is this a management style issue?

**What's missing:** You haven't identified potential procedural issues (why wasn't this addressed earlier?), power dynamics (David is Maria's manager), or organisational culture problems (two other employees find his style "difficult").

---

**CRITERION 2: Investigation Process - Score: 2/4**

You've identified the need for an investigation, but your description is too vague.

**What you wrote:** "Talking to both Maria and David to get both sides of the story."

**The problem:** A fair investigation requires more than just hearing "both sides." You need to:
- Interview the two employees who informally raised concerns
- Review any documented evidence (emails, performance reviews, meeting notes)
- Examine whether other team leaders received opportunities Maria was denied
- Maintain confidentiality and impartiality throughout
- Document everything

**What's missing:** Any mention of procedural fairness, natural justice, or legal compliance in the investigation process.

---

**CRITERION 3: Legal/Policy Application - Score: 1/4**

This is your weakest area. You haven't applied any specific legal principles or policies.

**What you wrote:** "This could lead to a lawsuit."

**The problem:** This is too vague. *What kind* of lawsuit? Under what legal theory? You need to reference specific legal risks like:
- Potential discrimination claim under the Fair Work Act (if there's evidence David's treatment relates to a protected characteristic)
- Potential bullying claim under work health and safety legislation
- Potential breach of the employer's duty of care

You also need to reference the organization's obligations—to provide a safe workplace, to investigate complaints fairly, to act on findings.

---

**CRITERION 4: Theoretical Integration - Score: 1/4**

You have not applied any psychological theory to your analysis.

**What's missing entirely:** There's no reference to conflict resolution theory, organisational justice theory, motivation theory, or any framework that would explain *why* this situation is problematic beyond "it's unfair." For example:
- Organisational justice theory explains why Maria perceives inequity
- Conflict resolution models would guide your intervention choice
- Leadership or management theory could inform what training David might need

---

**CRITERION 5: Risk Analysis - Score: 2/4**

You've identified two risks (lawsuit, resignation) but your analysis is shallow.

**What you wrote:** "This could lead to a lawsuit or Maria quitting."

**The problem:** These are possible outcomes, but you haven't explained *why* or *how* they might occur, or what other risks exist:
- Reputational damage if other employees witness inaction
- Decreased team morale and productivity
- Potential for retaliation against Maria if not handled carefully
- Liability if the organisation knew about the problem and didn't act

---

**CRITERION 6: Writing Quality - Score: 3/4**

Your writing is clear and easy to follow, which is good. However, it's quite informal for a professional HR analysis ("not being a good manager"). Use more precise, professional language.

---

**STRONGEST ASPECT:**
You correctly identified that this requires formal investigation and that there are consequences for inaction. You've grasped the seriousness of the situation.

**WEAKEST ASPECT:**
Complete lack of theoretical integration and very weak legal/policy analysis. You're describing the problem but not demonstrating deep HR knowledge or analytical skill.

---

**THREE SPECIFIC ACTIONS FOR REVISION:**

1. **Add legal specificity:** Research and cite at least two specific legal principles or obligations that apply here (e.g., employer's duty to provide a safe workplace under WHS legislation, prohibition of workplace bullying, Fair Work Act provisions on adverse action). Explain *how* these apply to the scenario.

2. **Integrate theory:** Choose one psychological or organisational theory (e.g., organisational justice theory, Adams' equity theory, or conflict resolution models) and explicitly use it to explain why Maria is experiencing the situation as unfair and/or to justify your recommended intervention.

3. **Detail the investigation:** Expand your investigation section to list at least five specific steps the HR team should take, including who should be interviewed, what documents should be reviewed, and how to ensure procedural fairness.

**CURRENT ESTIMATED SCORE: 11/24 (46%)**

This draft needs substantial development before submission. Focus on the three actions above and your score will improve significantly.

---

## The Impact on Learning

Notice what just happened:

1. **The student received specific, detailed feedback** identifying exactly what's missing
2. **The feedback is educational**, not just evaluative—it explains *why* things are problems and *what* good looks like
3. **The student has clear actions** for improvement
4. **The student can revise and resubmit to the AI** multiple times until they meet the standard

This is **formative assessment at scale**. Every student gets personalised feedback. They can iterate until they learn. And they arrive at your desk with work that's already been through multiple revision cycles.

---

## What You Grade

When students submit their final work, they also submit:

1. **Their final analysis** (the polished version)
2. **Evidence of their revision process**:
   - Screenshots or transcripts of AI feedback they received
   - A brief reflection (250 words) explaining:
     - What the AI identified as weak
     - What changes they made
     - What they learned from the process

### Grading Approach

You grade on **two dimensions**:

**Dimension 1: Quality of Final Work (70%)**
Use your rubric to assess the final submission. Because students have had the chance to improve with AI feedback, you should see much higher quality work overall.

**Dimension 2: Quality of Learning Process (30%)**
Assess their reflection:
- Did they engage meaningfully with the AI feedback?
- Did they make substantive revisions?
- Do they show metacognitive awareness (understanding of their own learning)?
- Did they critically evaluate the AI's suggestions or just accept them blindly?

**Key Question for Dimension 2:** "Did the student just ask AI to write it for them, or did they use AI to learn how to write better?"

### Red Flags for AI Misuse

If a student:
- Shows no evidence of revision between drafts
- Can't explain in their reflection what they changed or why
- Submits work that's suddenly far beyond their previous capability with no learning process shown
- Has AI feedback that's generic (suggesting they didn't actually use your provided prompt)

...then you have grounds for a conversation about academic integrity.

But the transparency model makes genuine misuse much harder, because students have to show their working.

---

## Variations and Adaptations

### Variation 1: Multiple Draft Checkpoints

Require students to submit:
- First draft + AI feedback (Week 8)
- Revised draft + AI feedback (Week 10)
- Final submission with reflection (Week 12)

This scaffolds the revision process and prevents last-minute cramming.

### Variation 2: Peer Review + AI Review

Students receive feedback from two sources:
- A peer using a structured peer review form
- The AI using your critique prompt

Then they write a reflection comparing the two types of feedback: What did each source notice? Where did they disagree? Which feedback was most helpful and why?

This teaches critical evaluation of feedback sources—an important professional skill.

### Variation 3: AI Critique Challenge

After receiving AI feedback, students must:
- Identify one piece of feedback they disagree with
- Argue why the AI is wrong or has misunderstood their work
- Provide evidence for their position

This prevents students from blindly accepting AI suggestions and develops critical thinking about AI limitations.

## Student-Facing Instructions

When you introduce this to students, be explicit about the learning model:

---

**HOW TO USE THE AI SELF-ASSESSMENT TOOL**

This assignment includes access to an AI feedback tool. Here's how to use it ethically and effectively:

**DO:**
- Use the AI to check your draft and identify areas for improvement
- Revise your work based on the feedback
- Run multiple drafts through the AI as you improve
- Think critically about whether the AI's suggestions are correct
- Use the AI to learn HR concepts and improve your analytical skills

**DON'T:**
- Ask the AI to write the assignment for you
- Copy-paste AI-generated text into your submission without understanding it
- Ignore the feedback and submit your first draft
- Treat the AI's feedback as infallible—it can be wrong

**REMEMBER:**
The goal is not to "beat the AI" or trick it into giving you a good score. The goal is to use the AI as a learning tool so that YOU understand HR analysis better by the time you submit.

You will submit evidence of your revision process, so I can see your learning journey. The quality of your final work AND your learning process will both be graded.

---

## Addressing Lecturer Concerns

**"Won't this just teach students to game the AI?"**

No—because you're assessing the learning process, not just the final product. Students who genuinely engage with feedback and revise their thinking will show that in their reflection. Students who just prompt-engineer to get a high score without learning will have nothing meaningful to say about what they learned.

**"What if the AI gives them incorrect feedback?"**

This is actually a valuable learning opportunity. If the AI makes an error (e.g., misapplies a legal principle), students who know their material will catch it and can challenge it in their reflection. This demonstrates higher-order thinking.

Also, because you're providing the critique prompt, you control the assessment criteria. The AI is applying *your* rubric, so it should align with your expectations.

**"Isn't this just making things easier for students?"**

No—it's making feedback faster and more accessible, but the cognitive work hasn't changed. Students still need to understand the concepts, apply theory correctly, and demonstrate critical thinking. The AI just accelerates the feedback loop so they can learn faster.

In fact, this model often reveals students who've been hiding behind vague writing—the AI forces them to be specific and substantive.

**"What about students who don't have access to AI tools?"**

If equity is a concern, you can:
- Provide access to AI tools through the university (many institutions now have educational subscriptions)
- Run the AI critique process in class or during office hours
- Make the AI feedback optional but provide other scaffolding for students who don't use it

---

## The Bigger Picture: Teaching AI Literacy

This transparency approach does something more important than preventing cheating: **it teaches students how to work with AI responsibly.**

In their HR careers, they'll have access to AI tools that can:
- Draft policies
- Analyse employment data
- Generate interview questions
- Summarize legal requirements

Your job isn't to prevent them from using these tools. It's to teach them:
- When AI is helpful and when it's risky
- How to critically evaluate AI outputs
- When human judgment must override AI suggestions
- How to use AI as a thinking partner, not a replacement for thinking

By making AI use transparent and educational, you're preparing them for professional practice in an AI-augmented world.

---

## Your Action Step

Before Chapter 6, try this:

1. **Choose one assignment** you currently give students
2. **Write the AI critique prompt** based on your existing rubric
3. **Test it:** Write a mediocre draft answer yourself and run it through the AI critique
4. **Evaluate:** Is the feedback accurate? Helpful? Aligned with your standards?
5. **Refine the prompt** until the AI gives the kind of feedback you'd want students to receive

Once you've tested it, you're ready to introduce this model in your class.

---

**Next Chapter Preview:** In Chapter 6, we'll explore the "future horizon"—creating a virtual HR company staffed by AI employees. Students interact with multiple AI personas (difficult employees, union representatives, senior managers) in an ongoing simulation that builds complexity over time. This is the most ambitious application, but it's becoming increasingly feasible with current technology.
