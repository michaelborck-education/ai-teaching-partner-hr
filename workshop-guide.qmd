## Workshop Agenda (60 minutes)

### Segment 1: Opening and Context (10 minutes)

**Slide 1: Title Slide**
"AI as a Teaching Partner: Practical Applications for Multidisciplinary Business Education"

**Slide 2: The Challenge We Face**

Show a scenario relevant to your discipline:

::: {.panel-tabset}

## HR
> "You have 60 students. They all need practice with difficult conversations—disciplinary meetings, investigation interviews, conflict resolution. Traditional role-play allows 5 students to practice per 2-hour session. It would take 12 weeks to give everyone one turn.
>
> **What if every student could practice 10 times before the real assessment?**"

## Marketing
> "You have 60 students. They all need practice with customer negotiations and competitive analysis. Traditional case study allows whole-class analysis but limited individual practice.
>
> **What if every student could practice pitching to difficult customers 10 times before their real assessment?**"

## Management
> "You have 60 students. They all need practice with change management and stakeholder negotiation. Traditional simulations require extensive preparation.
>
> **What if every student could practice managing resistance 10 times before their actual project?**"

## Accounting & Finance
> "You have 60 students. They all need practice with audit judgment and financial analysis. Traditional case studies are static and passive.
>
> **What if every student could practice financial decision-making 10 times before real assessments?**"

## Supply Chain & Logistics
> "You have 60 students. They all need practice with supply disruption decisions and supplier negotiations. Real-world scenarios are limited.
>
> **What if every student could practice crisis response 10 times before they face real situations?**"

## Information Systems
> "You have 60 students. They all need practice with requirements gathering and stakeholder management. IT projects are unpredictable and rare.
>
> **What if every student could practice managing difficult implementations 10 times before real projects?**"

:::


**Key message:** AI isn't about replacing teaching—it's about scaling things we know work but can't do for everyone.

**Slide 3: What AI Is (and Isn't)**

Keep it simple:
- **What AI is:** A very sophisticated text pattern generator that can follow instructions, role-play, and analyse text
- **What AI isn't:** Intelligent, creative, or reliable without human oversight
- **Key point:** Think of it as a tireless teaching assistant that never gets exhausted but needs your expertise to guide it

**Talk track:**
> "If you can copy and paste text, you can use AI. This isn't about being technical. It's about knowing what to ask for and critically evaluating what you get back. That's exactly what we teach our students to do with research sources—and it applies here too."

---

### Segment 2: Live Demonstration (20 minutes)

This is the heart of the workshop. Show, don't just tell.

**Demo 1: Bad Prompt vs. Good Prompt (5 minutes)**

**Project this on screen:**

*Bad Prompt:*
```
Write a case study about HR.
```

**Type it into ChatGPT/Claude live. Show the generic result.**

**Say:**
> "This is what happens when we're vague. The AI has to guess what we want. Now watch what happens when we're specific."

*Good Prompt (Discipline-Specific Example):*

::: {.panel-tabset}

## HR
```
You are an expert lecturer in Human Resource Management.

Create a 400-word case study for third-year undergraduate students about a
performance management conflict. The scenario should involve an employee
claiming unfair treatment and should require students to apply procedural
fairness principles and organisational justice theory.

Include 3 discussion questions that require critical analysis.

Begin.
```

## Marketing
```
You are an expert lecturer in Marketing.

Create a 400-word case study for third-year undergraduate students about a
brand crisis and competitive response. The scenario should involve a marketing
failure and require students to apply competitive strategy and crisis management
theory.

Include 3 discussion questions that require critical analysis.

Begin.
```

## Accounting
```
You are an expert lecturer in Accounting.

Create a 400-word case study for third-year undergraduate students about a
financial reporting dilemma. The scenario should involve ambiguous accounting
treatment and require students to apply relevant standards and professional
judgment.

Include 3 discussion questions that require critical analysis.

Begin.
```

## Management
```
You are an expert lecturer in Management.

Create a 400-word case study for third-year undergraduate students about a
change management challenge. The scenario should involve stakeholder resistance
and require students to apply leadership and organisational change theory.

Include 3 discussion questions that require critical analysis.

Begin.
```

:::


**Type it live. Show the much better result.**

**Say:**
> "Same tool, different instruction. The quality of what we get depends entirely on the quality of what we ask for. This is the fundamental skill—knowing what to ask."

**Debrief (1 minute):**
Ask: "What made the second prompt better?"
Expected answers: specificity, context, clear requirements, role definition

---

**Demo 2: Conversation Simulation (10 minutes)**

**Say:**
> "Now let me show you something more powerful. I'm going to have a conversation with an AI that's playing a difficult employee. Watch how this works."

**Project and type this setup prompt:**

```
You are Jamie, a team leader who has been called into a meeting with HR
because a team member complained about your "micromanagement."

Your perspective: You believe you're doing your job properly and that the
employee is oversensitive. You're defensive but professional.

Hidden context: You've been under enormous pressure to meet targets and
haven't had any management training. You'll reveal this only if the HR
person asks good questions and shows empathy.

I am the HR representative conducting this meeting. Stay in character.

I'll begin: "Thanks for meeting with me today, Jamie. I wanted to talk with
you about some concerns that have been raised..."
```

**Then have the conversation live** (aim for 5-7 exchanges). Make some deliberate mistakes so participants see it's not perfect:
- Ask a leading question to show AI can respond to poor technique
- Show empathy to trigger the AI revealing hidden context
- Demonstrate realistic back-and-forth

**After the conversation, say:**
> "Now imagine every student can practice this scenario five times before their actual assessment. They can make mistakes, learn from them, and try again—all without requiring me to role-play 60 times or arranging peer practice that's inconsistent.
>
> After the conversation, students submit the transcript and I can assess their actual process—how they asked questions, built rapport, handled resistance. That's much more valuable than asking them to write an essay about what they *would* do."

**Debrief (2 minutes):**
Ask: "How could you use something like this in a class you teach?"
Capture 2-3 responses on whiteboard

---

**Demo 3: AI as Feedback Tool (5 minutes)**

**Say:**
> "One more quick example. We all know students need more feedback than we have time to provide. Watch this."

**Show a mediocre student response to a case study** (prepare this in advance—2-3 paragraphs with identifiable flaws).

**Type this prompt live:**

```
You are an HR lecturer. A student submitted this response to a case study
about workplace conflict.

Evaluate it against these criteria:
- Did they identify the key issues?
- Did they apply relevant theory?
- Is their recommendation practical and justified?

For each criterion, provide specific feedback with examples from their
response. Tell them what's strong and what needs improvement.

Here is the student's response:
[paste the prepared example]
```

**Show the detailed feedback AI generates.**

**Say:**
> "Students can use this to check their draft before submission. They get immediate, specific feedback. Then they revise. The work I grade is much better because they've already gone through a revision cycle.
>
> I'm not outsourcing grading to AI—I still grade the final work. But AI provides the formative feedback that helps students improve along the way."

---

### Segment 3: Hands-On Practice (20 minutes)

**Say:**
> "Your turn. I want you to write one prompt for something you actually teach. You can work individually or pair up."

**Hand out the Quick Start Template** (see template below)

**Give them 3 options:**

**Option 1:** Write a prompt that generates teaching content (case study, scenario, discussion questions)

**Option 2:** Write a prompt that creates a role-play persona for students to practice with

**Option 3:** Write a prompt that provides feedback on student work

**Circulate and help** as they write. Encourage them to:
- Be specific about their audience (what year, what prior knowledge)
- Define the context (industry, location, type of problem)
- State what they want the output to include

**After 10 minutes, ask for volunteers to test their prompt** (if participants have devices and internet)

**Or test 2-3 prompts yourself live** if participants don't have devices

**Show results and discuss:**
- What worked well?
- What would you refine?
- How could you use this in your next class?

---

### Segment 4: Addressing Concerns and Next Steps (10 minutes)

**Anticipated Questions/Concerns—Address Proactively:**

**Q: "What about academic integrity? Won't students just cheat?"**

**A:**
> "Great question. This booklet includes a whole chapter on this (Chapter 9). Short answer: We make AI use transparent and expected, then we grade students on their critical use of AI, not their avoidance of it. We teach them to *critique* AI outputs and improve on them. That's harder than avoiding AI—and it's a professional skill they'll need."

**Q: "I'm not technical. Is this too complex for me?"**

**A:**
> "If you can use Google, you can use AI. The technical part is handled by the AI companies. Your job is the same as always—design good learning experiences, set clear objectives, assess student work. AI is just a tool, like a textbook or a case study database."

**Q: "What if AI gives incorrect information?"**

**A:**
> "It absolutely can—and that's a teaching opportunity. When we teach students to critically evaluate AI outputs and catch errors, we're building exactly the kind of critical thinking we want. AI isn't an oracle. It's a tool that requires human oversight."

**Q: "How much time does this take?"**

**A:**
> "Initial setup takes longer—maybe 1-2 hours to write and test a good prompt. But once it's created, you can reuse it every semester. And it can save time on grading by providing initial formative feedback that improves the quality of work you receive."

---

**Next Steps (5 minutes)**

**Provide participants with:**

1. **Digital copy of this booklet** or link to access it

2. **The Quick Start Guide handout** (one-page reference)

3. **Three concrete actions they can take:**

   **Action 1 (This week):**
   "Create one prompt for something you're teaching in the next month. Test it yourself. Refine it."

   **Action 2 (This month):**
   "Try one low-stakes AI activity with your students—either an optional practice exercise or an in-class demonstration."

   **Action 3 (This semester):**
   "Pilot one AI-enhanced assignment. Start small—maybe worth 10-15% of the grade."

4. **Offer ongoing support:**
   - Your email for questions
   - Offer to meet individually with anyone who wants help implementing
   - Suggest forming a faculty learning community around AI experimentation

## Facilitation Tips

### Managing Skepticism

**If someone says:** "This is just a fad / AI will make students lazy / This undermines real learning"

**Respond with:**
> "I hear your concern. Let me ask—what do you most wish your students could practice before they face high-stakes assessments? [Listen] This is a tool for scaling that practice. You still design the learning, set the standards, and grade the work. AI just makes personalised practice feasible for all students, not just a lucky few."

### Managing Enthusiasm

**If someone wants to immediately overhaul their entire curriculum:**

**Respond with:**
> "I love your enthusiasm! I'd encourage starting with one small experiment first—maybe just one assignment or one in-class activity. Test it, get student feedback, refine it. Then expand. Small pilots reduce risk and help you learn what works in your specific context."

### Managing Technical Anxiety

**If someone says:** "I'm not good with technology"

**Respond with:**
> "You don't need to be. If you can type a question into Google, you can use AI. Let me show you again—it's literally just typing instructions and reading what comes back. The challenge is pedagogical, not technical: What do you want students to learn? How will you assess it? Those are teaching questions, not tech questions."

---

## Key Messages to Reinforce Throughout

1. **AI as scaffolding, not replacement:** You're still the expert. AI just helps build the framework faster.

2. **Start small, scale gradually:** One prompt, one assignment, one semester. Build from there.

3. **Focus on learning, not technology:** The goal is better student outcomes, not using AI for its own sake.

4. **Transparency over prohibition:** Teach students to use AI responsibly, not to hide it.

5. **You're not alone:** Offer ongoing support and create a community of practice.

---

## Success Indicators (How to Know the Workshop Worked)

**Immediate (during workshop):**
- Participants actively engage in hands-on practice
- At least half the room tries writing a prompt
- Questions shift from "why?" to "how?" (skepticism to curiosity)

**Short-term (1-2 weeks after):**
- At least 3-5 participants report trying something with AI
- You receive follow-up questions via email
- Participants share examples with colleagues

**Long-term (end of semester):**
- At least 2-3 faculty implement AI-enhanced assignments
- Student feedback on AI-integrated teaching is positive
- Faculty request advanced workshop or ongoing support

---

## Final Facilitation Note

**Your goal is not to convince everyone to use AI.**

Your goal is to:
- Demystify AI (show it's accessible, not scary)
- Spark curiosity (show what's possible)
- Provide a pathway (give them tools and support)
- Build confidence (help them take a small first step)

Some participants will leave excited and implement immediately. Some will wait and watch. Some will remain skeptical. All of those responses are fine.

**Success is planting the seed and offering the support.**

The faculty members who are ready will grow from there.

Good luck with your workshop!
