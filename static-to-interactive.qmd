# From Static to Interactive - AI-Powered Activity Transformation

## The Challenge: Static Documents Don't Engage

You have a well-designed case study in Word or PDF. Students read it, maybe discuss it, then move on. The learning moment is brief and passive.

**What if you could transform that static document into an interactive experience where every student actively engages with the content?**

---

## The Solution: AI-Generated Interactive HTML

### What It Looks Like
- **Interactive case studies** with input fields for student responses
- **Decision trees** where choices lead to different outcomes  
- **Reflection prompts** with saveable responses
- **Self-assessment checklists** with immediate feedback
- **Scenario simulations** with branching paths

### Why HTML?
- **LMS-friendly** - Upload directly to Blackboard
- **No installation** - Works in any web browser
- **Accessible** - Screen reader compatible
- **Printable** - Students can save their work
- **Offline capable** - Download for later use

### Step 1: Prepare Your Static Content
1. **Identify the document** (case study, worksheet, activity guide)
2. **Locate interaction points** (questions, decisions, reflections)
3. **Mark enhancement opportunities** (where could students input/respond?)

### Step 2: Use AI to Generate Interactive HTML

#### **Prompt Template for Basic Transformation**
```
Transform this static [document type] into an interactive HTML webpage:

[Paste your document content here]
