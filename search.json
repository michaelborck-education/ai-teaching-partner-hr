Transparency Over Prohibition\nRather than trying to prevent AI use (impossible and counterproductive), we teach students to use AI openly, critically, and ethically. This prepares them for professional HR practice where AI tools are standard.\n3. Start Small, Scale Gradually\nYou don’t need to revolutionize your entire curriculum overnight.

You can give them case studies to analyse. You can even do role-plays in class. But here’s what you can’t easily do:\n\nLet every student practice a difficult termination conversation multiple times until they get it right\nGive them immediate, detailed feedback on their communication style in a grievance meeting\nCreate 30 different complex HR scenarios tailored to each student’s learning needs\nAllow them to make catastrophic mistakes (firing someone illegally, violating privacy laws, mishandling discrimination) in a risk-free environment\nScale personalised practice to hundreds of students\n\nUntil now.",

    "text": "2.4 What Makes This Different from Traditional Teaching?\nTraditional HR education often focuses on product—the final answer, the correct policy, the right theoretical framework. Students write essays, complete exams, and submit reports that demonstrate they know things.\nBut HR professional work is about process—the methodology of how you investigate a complaint, the approach you take in a negotiation, the steps you follow to ensure fair dismissal, the communication style you use to de-escalate conflict.\nAI allows us to assess and teach process, not just product.\nInstead of asking “Can the student define procedural fairness?” we can now ask: - “Watch this student conduct a disciplinary meeting. Did they actually demonstrate procedural fairness?” - “Review this student’s conversation with an underperforming employee. Did they apply motivational theory appropriately?” - “Analyse how this student navigated a discrimination complaint. Where did their process break down?”\nThis shift—from testing knowledge recall to evaluating applied professional methodology—is transformational for HR education.",

    "text": "2.5 Three Core Principles of This Approach\nAs you read through this booklet and begin experimenting with AI in your teaching, keep these three principles in mind:\n\n2.5.1 1. AI as Scaffolding, Not Replacement\nAI is like a construction crew that can quickly build the framework for complex learning scenarios—generating interview questions, drafting policy outlines, creating simulated employees, analysing student responses. But your role as the educator is irreplaceable: you design the learning objectives, you set the ethical boundaries, you guide students to inspect and refine their work, and you ensure the final structure is robust and professionally sound.\n\n\n2.5.2 2. Transparency Over Prohibition\nMany educators worry about students using AI to cheat. This booklet takes the opposite approach: give students the AI tools, teach them to use AI ethically, and grade them on their ability to critically evaluate and improve AI outputs.\nIn the real world, HR professionals will use AI tools. Our job isn’t to prevent that—it’s to ensure they can use them responsibly, identify their limitations, and maintain human judgment on ethical and legal matters.\n\n\n2.5.3 3. Start Simple, Scale Gradually\nYou don’t need to revolutionize your entire curriculum tomorrow. This booklet will show you how to start with a single prompt, try one simulation exercise, or enhance one assessment. Each chapter builds progressively, so you can adopt techniques at your own pace.",

One conversation where a student gets to practice being an HR professional in a safe environment before they step into the real world.\nBecause ultimately, that’s what we’re here for: to send confident, competent, ethical HR professionals out into workplaces where they’ll face situations we can’t fully predict or control. AI gives us a way to prepare them better.\nLet’s begin.\n\nNext Chapter Preview: In Chapter 2, you’ll have your first conversation with an AI tool. We’ll walk through exactly what to type, what to expect, and how to think about prompts as instructions to a very capable (but not infallible) assistant.",

You could also say: - “You are an experienced HR Business Partner coaching a new manager” - “You are a union representative negotiating with management” - “You are a frustrated employee who believes they’ve been unfairly treated”\nThe role shapes the tone, vocabulary, and approach of the response.\n\n\n3.6.2 2. Define the Context and Audience\n\n“I need you to create a case study for my undergraduate students…”\n\nWho is this for? What’s the purpose? This prevents the AI from pitching the content at the wrong level (too simple for postgrads, too complex for first-years).\n\n\n3.6.3 3. Specify the Task Clearly\n\n“…that will help them practice applying employment law to a workplace conflict.”\n\nWhat exactly do you want? Don’t just say “write something about employment law.” Say what the student should do with it.\n\n\n3.6.4 4. Provide Constraints and Requirements\n\n“The scenario should involve…” “Include enough detail…” “300-400 words…” “End with three discussion questions…”\n\nThese boundaries guide the AI and prevent it from going off in unhelpful directions. Think of constraints as guardrails.\n\n\n3.6.5 5. Give a Clear Start Signal\n\n“Begin.”\n\nThis tells the AI to execute the task now. Simple, but effective.",

One that asks the AI to role-play someone (an angry employee, a nervous manager, a compliance officer) 3. One that asks the AI to analyse or critique something (feed it a sample student response or a policy and ask it to evaluate against specific criteria)\nGet comfortable with the basic rhythm: prompt → response → refine → use.\nThe more you practice, the more natural it becomes. And the more specific your prompts, the more useful your outputs.\n\nNext Chapter Preview: In Chapter 3, you’ll learn five specific prompting techniques that are perfectly suited to HR education. Each one is designed to develop a different critical thinking skill in your students: scoping problems, evaluating options, following processes, practicing conversations, and debating ethical positions. These aren’t just “AI tricks”—they’re pedagogical strategies that AI makes scalable.",

This phase is about building your own confidence and discovering what works.\n\n4.2.1 Week 1: Your First Prompts\nTime investment: 1-2 hours\nTask: Generate three teaching resources you currently need using the techniques from Chapter 3.\nExamples: - Use the Pros and Cons technique to create a comparative analysis of performance review models (you can use this as lecture content or a discussion prompt) - Use the Role Play technique to create a practice scenario for difficult conversations - Use the Reverse Prompting technique to help you scope out a complex policy assignment\nSuccess metric: You created at least one resource that’s good enough to use in your teaching (even if it needs minor adjustments).\nWhat you’ll learn: - How to write effective prompts for your specific content - What AI does well and where it needs your expertise - How to iterate and refine prompts to get better results\n\n\n4.2.2 Week 2: Test a Simulation\nTime investment: 30 minutes\nTask: Conduct a conversation simulation yourself using the Flight Simulator model from Chapter 4.\nSteps: 1. Write a setup prompt for a scenario you teach (performance management, conflict resolution, recruitment interview, etc.) 2. Have the conversation with the AI—actually practice the skill yourself 3. Generate a critique of your performance using the debrief prompt\nSuccess metric: The AI stayed in character throughout, and the critique provided specific, useful feedback.\nWhat you’ll learn: - Whether your scenario design creates a realistic challenge - How students will experience this exercise - What kinds of feedback the AI generates (and whether it aligns with your standards)\n\n\n4.2.3 Week 3: Review Your Current Assessments\nTime investment: 1 hour\nTask: Look at your current assignments and identify which ones could be enhanced with AI.\nQuestions to ask: - Which assignments currently test knowledge recall that could test applied process instead? - Where do students struggle to get timely feedback? - Which skills do students need more practice with before assessment? - What do you wish you had time to grade more thoroughly?\nSuccess metric: You’ve identified one specific assignment that you’ll pilot in the next teaching cycle.\nWhat you’ll learn: - Where AI can add the most value in your specific context - What problems you’re actually trying to solve (not just “use AI because it’s new”)",

    "text": "4.3 Phase 2: Low-Stakes Student Introduction (First Month of Semester)\nYou’re now ready to introduce AI to students. Start with optional, low-stakes activities—not high-stakes assessments.\n\n4.3.1 Approach 1: Optional Practice Exercise\nWhat to do:\nIntroduce AI as a practice tool for an upcoming assignment.\nExample announcement to students:\n\n“For the case study assignment due in Week 8, I want to give you a chance to practice your analytical skills first. I’ve created an AI critique prompt that you can use to check your draft before submission.\nHere’s how it works: Write your draft analysis, paste it into ChatGPT or Claude along with this critique prompt [provide prompt], and see what feedback you get. Then revise based on the feedback.\nThis is completely optional—I won’t know whether you used it or not. But I encourage you to try it at least once to see if it helps you improve your work.”\n\nWhy this works: - No pressure—students who are skeptical can ignore it - Students who try it will likely see value and spread the word to peers - You can gauge student response before making it mandatory - You avoid the “forced adoption” resistance\n\n\n4.3.2 Approach 2: In-Class Demonstration\nWhat to do:\nDuring a lecture, demonstrate AI in action as a teaching tool.\nExample:\n\n“Today we’re learning about procedural fairness in disciplinary processes. Let me show you something interesting. I’m going to ask an AI to role-play an employee going through a disciplinary meeting, and I want you to watch and critique my process.”\n\nThen conduct a live conversation with the AI projected on screen. Students observe and analyse your performance in real-time.\nFollow-up: - Ask students: “What did I do well? What did I miss?” - Show how AI can provide a critique: paste the transcript into the critique prompt live - Discuss: “Did the AI catch the same things you did? Did it miss anything?”\nWhy this works: - Demystifies AI (students see it’s just a tool, not magic) - Models critical thinking about AI outputs - Shows your own willingness to be vulnerable and learn - Sparks curiosity about trying it themselves\n\n\n4.3.3 Approach 3: Reflective Exercise\nWhat to do:\nAssign a short, reflective writing task where students experiment with AI rather than complete a traditional assignment.\nExample assignment:\n\nAssignment: Exploring AI as an HR Tool (5% of grade)\nTask: 1. Choose one HR skill we’ve covered this semester (e.g., conducting an investigation, drafting a policy, analysing turnover data) 2. Use an AI tool (ChatGPT, Claude, or similar) to help you practice or analyse that skill 3. Write a 500-word reflection answering: - What task did you ask the AI to help with? - What was useful about the AI’s response? - What was wrong, missing, or oversimplified in the AI’s response? - How would you use (or not use) AI for this kind of task in professional practice?\nGrading: You’re being graded on your critical reflection, not on the AI’s performance. Honest critique of AI’s limitations will score higher than uncritical praise.\n\nWhy this works: - Low stakes (only 5% of grade) - Emphasizes critical thinking about AI rather than reliance on AI - Introduces AI literacy as a learning objective - Gives you insight into how students are using AI",

    "text": "4.4 Phase 3: Pilot Assessment (Mid-Semester)\nAfter students have some familiarity with AI, introduce one AI-enhanced assessment. Choose something meaningful but not the highest-stakes assignment.\n\n4.4.1 Implementation Checklist\nBefore you launch:\n\nYou’ve tested the prompts yourself thoroughly\nYou’ve created clear student instructions (what to do, how to do it, what’s expected)\nYou’ve prepared a FAQ document anticipating student questions\nYou’ve decided how much this is worth (recommend 15-25% of final grade for first pilot)\nYou’ve built in time for technical issues (some students will need help accessing AI tools)\n\nChoose your model:\nBased on Chapters 4-7, select one approach for a single assignment:\nOption A: Conversation Simulation + Reflection (Chapter 4) - Lower workload for grading - Students are most likely to find this engaging - Easiest to explain\nOption B: Self-Assessment with Transparency Model (Chapter 5) - Works for existing essay/case study assignments - Minimal restructuring needed - Good introduction to AI literacy\nOption C: AI Critique and Override (Chapter 7, Model 3) - Medium complexity - Strong focus on critical thinking - Clear demonstration of learning\nDon’t choose: Virtual company simulation (Chapter 6) or complex multi-part process assessment (Chapter 7, Models 1-2) for your first pilot. Save those for when you have more experience.\n\nThinking bigger than a single assignment?\nIf you’re ready to redesign an entire unit from the ground up rather than piloting a single assignment, see Chapter 10: Designing an AI-Integrated Unit for a complete backwards design framework. That chapter shows how to: - Map AI integration across a full 12-week semester - Build scaffolded progression from Week 1 to Week 12 - Balance AI-enhanced and traditional learning activities - Support student AI literacy development throughout the unit\nMost lecturers should start with a single assignment pilot before attempting whole-unit redesign. Once you’ve successfully piloted one AI-enhanced assignment and gathered student feedback, you’ll be in a much stronger position to expand your approach across an entire unit.\n\n\n4.4.2 Launch Week: Student Orientation\nDedicate 15-20 minutes of class time to:\n\nExplain the “why” &gt; “We’re trying something new with this assignment because I want you to practice professional skills, not just write about them. In HR work, you’ll use AI tools, so learning to use them critically is part of your education.”\nAddress the anxiety &gt; “Some of you might be worried this is too technical—it’s not. If you can copy and paste text, you can do this assignment. Some of you might be thinking this makes things easier—actually, it makes things harder, because I’m assessing your thinking process, not just your final answer.”\nDo a live demo\n\nShow exactly how to access the AI tool\nShow exactly how to paste the prompt\nShow exactly what happens next\nShow what they submit to you\n\nOpen for questions\nProvide written instructions\n\nCreate a one-page step-by-step guide students can refer back to\nInclude screenshots if needed\nProvide a technical support contact (could be you, a TA, or IT support)\n\n\n\n\n4.4.3 During the Assignment Period: Be Available\nCommon student issues:\n“The AI isn’t staying in character” → Response: Check that you copied the full prompt. Try starting a fresh conversation.\n“The AI gave me weird feedback” → Response: That’s possible—AI can make errors. In your reflection, explain what the AI got wrong and why. You’ll get credit for catching the error.\n“I don’t have access to ChatGPT” → Response: Try Claude.ai instead, or come to office hours and we can run it together.\n“Is this even allowed? Am I cheating?” → Response: Yes, it’s allowed—this is the assignment. You’re being graded on your critical use of AI, not on avoiding it.\n\n\n4.4.4 After Submission: Grading Efficiently\nCreate a grading workflow:\n\nQuick initial scan (5 minutes per student)\n\nDid they follow instructions?\nDid they submit all required components?\nAny obvious red flags (e.g., obviously didn’t do the work)?\n\nDeep assessment (15-20 minutes per student)\n\nReview the transcript/analysis/reflection against your rubric\nLook for evidence of learning and critical thinking\nProvide targeted feedback (2-3 specific comments)\n\nUse standard comment banks\n\nCreate a document with common feedback phrases you can copy-paste\nExamples: “Strong application of procedural fairness here,” “This needed more specific evidence from the transcript,” “Excellent critique of AI’s oversight”\n\n\nTime-saving tip: Use AI itself to help with initial feedback:\nYour prompt to AI:\nYou are assisting with grading. Review this student's submission against\nthe rubric [paste rubric]. Provide an initial assessment and draft\nfeedback comments.\n\nI will review your assessment and make final decisions—do not assign\nfinal grades, just provide recommendations.\n\n[paste student work]\nThen you review AI’s suggestions, adjust where needed, and add your own judgment. This can cut grading time by 30-40%.",

But in HR work, you’ll use AI tools whether you like them or not. My job is to prepare you for professional practice, and that now includes knowing when and how to use AI responsibly. I’m not asking you to become an AI expert—just to be a critical user.”\n“I don’t trust AI / I think AI is unethical”\nResponse: &gt; “That’s actually a valuable perspective. This assignment is a chance for you to critically evaluate AI’s limitations and biases. In fact, students who identify what AI gets wrong often score highest, because that demonstrates critical thinking. You don’t have to like AI—you just need to understand it.”\n\n\n4.7.2 Challenge 2: Resistance from Colleagues\n“You’re just making things easier for students”\nResponse: &gt; “Actually, it’s harder—students can’t just memorize and regurgitate anymore. They have to think critically and demonstrate process. The AI doesn’t give them answers; it creates dynamic challenges they have to navigate.”\n“AI feedback isn’t as good as human feedback”\nResponse: &gt; “You’re right—that’s why I’m still grading the final work. But AI feedback is instant and available 24/7. Students can practice and revise multiple times before submission. That’s pedagogically valuable even if AI feedback isn’t perfect.”\n“What about academic integrity?”\nResponse: &gt; “This approach actually makes cheating harder. I’m assessing their process and critical thinking, not just final answers. And by teaching students to use AI transparently, I’m building integrity rather than policing violations.”\n\n\n4.7.3 Challenge 3: Technology Failures\n“The AI platform was down during the assignment period”\nStudents affected: Build in flexibility—allow extensions or alternative submission methods if technical issues occur.\nPrevention: Provide multiple AI tool options (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) so students have backups.\n\n\n4.7.4 Challenge 4: Uneven Student Access\n“Some students don’t have reliable internet or devices”\nSolutions: - Provide lab time where students can complete the assignment on campus - Offer office hours where you can facilitate the AI interaction together - Check if your university has institutional AI tool subscriptions - Design assignments that can be completed in short sessions (don’t require hours of continuous AI access)\n\n\n4.7.5 Challenge 5: You’re Overwhelmed\n“This is taking more time than expected and I’m drowning”\nEmergency strategies: - Reduce the weight of the AI assignment (make it formative, not summative) - Make reflection/analysis shorter (250 words instead of 500) - Grade on completion rather than detailed quality for this first round - Ask for teaching assistant support if available - Remember: It gets easier the second time\nLong-term: Building AI-enhanced assignments is front-loaded work. Year 1 is significant effort. Year 2 is refinement. Year 3 is almost autopilot.",

It’s about being a committed educator who wants students to be genuinely prepared for professional practice.\nYou don’t need to revolutionize your entire curriculum overnight. You don’t need to be perfect. You just need to start.\nYour first AI-enhanced assignment will be imperfect. Do it anyway.\nYou’ll discover what works in your context, with your students, for your content. Every lecturer’s implementation will look slightly different—and that’s exactly right.\nThe chapters before this showed you what’s possible. This chapter showed you how to make it real.\nNow it’s time to choose your first small experiment and try it.\n\nNext Chapter Preview: In Chapter 9, we directly address the academic integrity and ethics question. You’ll learn how to talk to students about AI use, how to design assignments that minimise misuse while maximizing learning, and how to reframe “preventing AI cheating” as “teaching AI literacy and professional ethics.” This is the conversation you’ll need to have with students, colleagues, and possibly administrators.",

    "text": "5.2 Technique 1: Reverse Prompting (for Scoping and Policy Design)\n\n5.2.1 What It Does\nInstead of the student immediately solving a problem, the AI asks them questions to help scope out all the requirements, considerations, and potential issues. This mirrors real HR work, where defining the problem properly is half the battle.\n\n\n5.2.2 Why It Works for HR\nHR policy and program design require thinking through multiple stakeholders, legal requirements, operational constraints, and fairness implications. This technique forces students to move beyond obvious surface issues and consider the full complexity.\n\n\n5.2.3 The Student Prompt (Ready to Use)\nI need to draft a new \"Flexible Work Arrangement\" policy for a 500-employee\ncompany that has both office-based and remote staff. I need to make sure I\ncover all the key areas.\n\nYour task: Ask me a series of yes/no or short-answer questions to help me\nclarify all the requirements, considerations, and potential pitfalls for\nthis policy.\n\nAsk one question at a time. Wait for my response before asking the next\nquestion. Continue until you've helped me think through at least 10\ndifferent aspects of this policy.\n\nBegin with your first question.\n\n\n5.2.4 What Happens\nThe AI will start asking questions like: - “Will all roles be eligible for flexible arrangements, or will there be specific criteria?” - “Have you considered how this will affect team collaboration and meeting schedules?” - “What equipment or technology support will the company provide for remote workers?” - “How will you handle performance measurement for remote versus office staff?” - “Are there legal or insurance implications you need to address?”\nThe student must think through each question before responding. By the end, they’ve been guided to consider fairness, logistics, legal compliance, technology needs, and cultural impact—all before drafting a single policy sentence.\n\n\n5.2.5 Variations for Different Topics\n\n“I need to design an onboarding program for graduate hires. Ask me questions to ensure I’ve thought through all the key elements.”\n“I’m planning a diversity and inclusion initiative. Help me identify all the stakeholders and considerations through questioning.”\n“I need to restructure our performance review process. What questions should I be asking myself to ensure it’s fair and effective?”\n\n\n\n5.2.6 Teaching Tip\nUse this as a pre-writing exercise. Have students complete the AI questioning session, then require them to submit both the transcript and their subsequent policy draft. You can assess whether they actually incorporated the insights from the questions.",

    "text": "5.3 Technique 2: Pros and Cons (for Decision Making)\n\n5.3.1 What It Does\nThe AI systematically analyzes multiple approaches to an HR problem, evaluating each option against specific criteria. This develops the ability to make justified recommendations rather than just stating preferences.\n\n\n5.3.2 Why It Works for HR\nHR professionals constantly evaluate competing strategies—Should we outsource recruitment? Which performance model should we adopt? How should we handle redundancy? This technique builds the muscle for balanced, evidence-based decision-making.\n\n\n5.3.3 The Student Prompt (Ready to Use)\nWhat are the main models for conducting performance reviews in a hybrid\nworkforce? For each model you identify, provide:\n\n1. A brief description of how it works\n2. Three key advantages\n3. Three key disadvantages\n\nEvaluate each model specifically in terms of:\n- Fairness and perceived equity\n- Administrative overhead and manager workload\n- Impact on employee morale and development\n\nConclude with a recommendation for which model would be most appropriate\nfor a mid-sized tech company (300 employees, 60% hybrid, 40% fully remote)\nand justify your recommendation.\n\n\n5.3.4 What Happens\nThe AI will identify 3-4 performance review models (e.g., annual reviews, continuous feedback, 360-degree feedback, OKR-based systems) and analyse each systematically. The student receives a structured comparison that they must then critically evaluate.\n\n\n5.3.5 The Follow-Up Task\nDon’t let students simply accept the AI’s recommendation. Require them to: - Challenge one of the “pros” listed—is it really an advantage in all contexts? - Add a disadvantage the AI missed - Argue for a different model than the AI recommended, using evidence - Identify which psychological or motivational theory supports or contradicts each approach\nThis transforms the AI output from an answer into a starting point for deeper analysis.\n\n\n5.3.6 Variations for Different Topics\n\n“Compare different approaches to managing workplace conflict: mediation, formal grievance process, restorative justice. Evaluate each for speed, fairness, and relationship preservation.”\n“Analyze three different redundancy selection methods. What are the legal risks and ethical considerations of each?”\n“What are the pros and cons of using AI-powered resume screening tools versus traditional human review?”\n\n\n\n5.3.7 Teaching Tip\nThis technique works brilliantly for in-class discussions. Project the AI’s analysis on screen, then divide students into groups where each group must argue for one of the models. They have to use the AI’s framework but add their own reasoning.",

    "text": "5.4 Technique 3: Stepwise Chain of Thought (for Process Management)\n\n5.4.1 What It Does\nThe AI walks through a complex HR process one step at a time, pausing after each step until the student signals they’re ready to continue. This slows down high-stakes processes that students often rush through.\n\n\n5.4.2 Why It Works for HR\nMany HR processes—disciplinary action, grievance handling, redundancy consultation—are legally and ethically sensitive. Students need to understand why each step exists and what documentation or legal considerations apply at that stage. This technique forces deliberate, sequential thinking.\n\n\n5.4.3 The Student Prompt (Ready to Use)\nI am learning how to properly conduct a disciplinary action process for an\nemployee with a pattern of repeated lateness.\n\nYour task: Walk me through the entire disciplinary process, starting from\nthe very first informal conversation. For each step, tell me:\n\n1. What action to take\n2. What to document\n3. What legal or procedural consideration is important at this stage\n\nAfter you explain each step, STOP and wait for me to type \"next\" before\nmoving to the next step. Do not provide the entire process at once.\n\nBegin with Step 1.\n\n\n5.4.4 What Happens\nThe AI will provide the first step:\n\nStep 1: Informal Verbal Warning\nAction: Meet privately with the employee to discuss the lateness pattern. Use a calm, non-accusatory tone. Ask if there are any circumstances contributing to the issue (e.g., transport problems, personal issues, health concerns).\nDocumentation: Make a brief file note recording the date, what was discussed, and the employee’s response. This is informal, so no formal warning letter yet.\nLegal/Procedural Consideration: At this stage, you’re gathering information and providing an opportunity for the employee to explain. Under principles of procedural fairness, you must give them a chance to be heard before escalating.\nType “next” when you’re ready for Step 2.\n\nThe student must actively engage with each step before progressing. This prevents them from skipping to “just fire them” without understanding the required process.\n\n\n5.4.5 Variations for Different Topics\n\n“Walk me through conducting a workplace investigation into a bullying complaint. One step at a time.”\n“Take me through the proper process for making an employee redundant in Australia. Pause after each step.”\n“Show me the recruitment process from job analysis through to onboarding, step by step with legal checkpoints.”\n\n\n\n5.4.6 Teaching Tip\nThis is excellent for individual revision or exam prep. Students can practice the process multiple times, and each time they can ask the AI to introduce complications: “In Step 3, what if the employee refuses to sign the written warning?” The AI will explain how to handle variations.\nYou can also use this to generate assessment materials: Have the AI walk through a process, then you create an exam question where one of the steps was done incorrectly and students must identify the error and its consequences.",

    "text": "5.5 Technique 4: Role Play (for Skill Building)\n\n5.5.1 What It Does\nThe AI adopts a specific persona (an employee, a union representative, a difficult stakeholder) and engages in a realistic conversation with the student. This is the “flight simulator” concept in action.\n\n\n5.5.2 Why It Works for HR\nHR work is fundamentally conversational. Students can memorize conflict resolution theory, but until they practice actually having a difficult conversation where someone pushes back, gets emotional, or uses manipulative tactics, they won’t develop genuine competence.\n\n\n5.5.3 The Student Prompt (Ready to Use)\nYou are an experienced and empathetic HR Business Partner. I am a new,\nnervous manager who needs to put one of my team members on a Performance\nImprovement Plan (PIP).\n\nYour goal is to coach me through preparing for and conducting this meeting\nsuccessfully.\n\nGuide me through this step by step:\n1. First, ask me why the employee is being put on a PIP\n2. Wait for my answer\n3. If my answer is vague or subjective (e.g., \"bad attitude\"), challenge me\n   gently and ask me to be more specific and behavioural\n4. Once I give you a solid answer, move to the next aspect: helping me\n   draft clear, measurable objectives for the PIP\n5. Continue coaching me through each element of the conversation I need to\n   have with the employee\n\nThroughout this process, if I say something that could be problematic\n(legally risky, unfair, too harsh, or too vague), pause and give me\nfeedback on how to improve it.\n\nBegin by asking me your first question.\n\n\n5.5.4 What Happens\nThe AI becomes a coach who actively guides the student through preparation. If the student says “I’m putting them on a PIP because they’re lazy,” the AI will respond:\n\n“I understand you’re frustrated, but ‘lazy’ is subjective and not something we can measure or document defensibly. Let’s try again: what specific behaviours or performance gaps have you observed? For example, are they missing deadlines, producing work below the required standard, or not completing their assigned tasks?”\n\nThis iterative coaching helps students learn to think and speak like HR professionals.\n\n\n5.5.5 Advanced Variation: The Difficult Conversation\nOnce students are comfortable, flip the scenario:\nYou are Sarah, a high-performing marketing manager who has just been told\nyou're being put on a Performance Improvement Plan. You are shocked,\ndefensive, and angry because you believe this is unfair and politically\nmotivated.\n\nI am the HR representative who has to conduct this PIP meeting with you.\n\nYour behavior:\n- Start the conversation by immediately challenging the fairness of the PIP\n- Bring up a recent successful project you led\n- Hint that you believe this is retaliation for raising a complaint about\n  your manager last month\n- Be emotional but not abusive—show genuine distress\n\nI will attempt to conduct this meeting professionally. Stay in character\nuntil I manage to de-escalate the situation and establish a constructive\ndialogue.\n\nBegin the meeting. I will speak first.\nNow the student has to manage a realistic, emotionally charged scenario. They must practice de-escalation, empathy, procedural fairness, and documentation—all while the AI responds dynamically to what they say.\n\n\n5.5.6 Variations for Different Topics\n\nAI plays a union representative in an enterprise bargaining negotiation\nAI plays a candidate in a behavioural interview who gives weak answers that need probing\nAI plays a manager who resists implementing a diversity initiative\nAI plays an employee making an informal discrimination complaint\n\n\n\n5.5.7 Teaching Tip\nAssessment approach: Require students to submit the full transcript of the conversation along with a reflective analysis answering: - What communication techniques did you use? - Where did the conversation go well or poorly? - What would you do differently next time? - What HR theory or legal principle guided your approach?\nThis makes the process visible and assessable.",

    "text": "5.6 Technique 5: Debating (for Strategic and Ethical Analysis)\n\n5.6.1 What It Does\nThe AI examines multiple perspectives on a contentious HR issue, argues for and against different positions, and helps students see the complexity and trade-offs in strategic decisions.\n\n\n5.6.2 Why It Works for HR\nModern HR work exists in gray areas where legal, ethical, business, and human considerations often conflict. Students need to develop the ability to argue multiple sides of an issue before making a recommendation.\n\n\n5.6.3 Variation A: Critique and Compare\nI will provide you with two different \"Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)\"\npolicies from two fictional companies.\n\nYour task:\n1. Critique the strengths and weaknesses of each policy in terms of\n   security, employee privacy, and clarity\n2. Tell me which policy is stronger overall and why\n3. Identify one element from the weaker policy that could improve the\n   stronger one\n\nHere is Policy A: [paste policy]\nHere is Policy B: [paste policy]\n\nBegin your analysis.\nTeaching use: You draft two policies (or have the AI generate them), one deliberately flawed. Students must identify which is better and justify their reasoning. This develops critical evaluation skills.\n\n\n5.6.4 Variation B: Argue Both Sides\nI want you to debate the pros and cons of using AI-powered tools to scan\nresumes and filter job applicants.\n\nStructure your response in three parts:\n\n**Part 1: The Case FOR Using AI Resume Screening**\nMake the strongest possible argument in favour of this technology. Consider\nefficiency, consistency, potential to reduce human bias, cost savings, and\nscalability.\n\n**Part 2: The Case AGAINST Using AI Resume Screening**\nMake the strongest possible argument against this technology. Consider\nalgorithmic bias, legal risk, lack of contextual understanding, potential\ndiscrimination, and dehumanization of the recruitment process.\n\n**Part 3: Critical Synthesis**\nCritique both arguments you just made. What did each side get right? What\ndid each side oversimplify or ignore? Provide a balanced recommendation\nwith conditions (e.g., \"Use AI screening only if X, Y, and Z safeguards\nare in place\").\nWhat Happens: The AI will construct sophisticated arguments for both positions, then provide a nuanced synthesis. Students can’t just pick a side—they have to understand the legitimate concerns and benefits on both sides.\n\n\n5.6.5 Variation C: Multi-Stakeholder Debate\nThis is the most sophisticated version:\nYou will simulate a leadership debate on whether to implement a \"mandatory\nreturn to office\" policy requiring all employees to work in-office four\ndays per week.\n\nCreate three distinct personas and have them debate this issue:\n\n**Persona 1: The CFO (Chief Financial Officer)**\nFocus on: Real estate costs, productivity metrics, and financial efficiency\n\n**Persona 2: The CHRO (Chief HR Officer)**\nFocus on: Employee morale, retention, recruitment competitiveness, and\ndiversity/equity/inclusion implications\n\n**Persona 3: The COO (Chief Operating Officer)**\nFocus on: Team collaboration, operational consistency, training\neffectiveness, and company culture\n\nHave each persona make their opening argument (3-4 sentences each). Then\nhave them respond to each other's points. Continue the debate through three\nrounds until they need to make a recommendation to the CEO.\n\nAfter the debate, summarize the key tension points and what a compromise\npolicy might look like.\n\nBegin the debate.\nWhat Happens: The AI will create a realistic executive debate where each stakeholder has legitimate but competing priorities. Students see that there’s rarely a perfect answer—only trade-offs and compromise.\n\n\n5.6.6 Follow-Up Task for Students\nAfter reading the debate, students must: 1. Identify which stakeholder made the strongest argument and why 2. Propose a policy that addresses the COO’s concerns while minimising the CHRO’s risks 3. Explain what data or evidence would help resolve the CFO’s questions 4. Reflect on which psychological or organisational theory best explains the tension between these perspectives\n\n\n5.6.7 Teaching Tip\nThis technique is perfect for preparing students for case study exams. Instead of memorizing model answers, they practice analysing competing priorities and justifying nuanced positions—exactly what they’ll need to do in professional practice.",

This provides low-stakes repetition and immediate feedback—essential for skill development.\n\n\n5.7.2 Why It Works for HR\nMany HR competencies require both knowledge (legislation, theory) and application (recognizing situations where that knowledge applies). Students need more practice than traditional homework provides, but creating dozens of unique practice scenarios is time-prohibitive for lecturers. AI solves this.\n\n\n5.7.3 Use Case 1: Self-Testing Knowledge\nStudent Prompt:\nI'm studying for an exam on Australian employment law. I need to practice\nidentifying which legislation applies in different workplace scenarios.\n\nGenerate 10 short scenario descriptions (2-3 sentences each) where I need\nto identify:\n1. Which legislation is relevant (e.g., Fair Work Act, WHS Act,\n   Anti-Discrimination Act)\n2. What the employer's legal obligation is\n3. What risk exists if the employer doesn't comply\n\nAfter I answer each one, tell me if I'm correct and explain why.\n\nBegin with Scenario 1.\nWhat Happens: The AI creates scenario after scenario. Students test themselves, get immediate feedback, and can continue until they achieve mastery. Unlike a textbook with 5 practice problems, this provides unlimited practice.\nKey feature: AI adapts. If student gets several wrong, AI can simplify. If student masters basic scenarios, AI can make them more complex.\n\n\n\n5.7.4 Use Case 2: Application Practice\nStudent Prompt:\nI'm learning to identify different types of workplace conflict (task\nconflict, relationship conflict, process conflict).\n\nCreate 8 brief workplace scenarios. For each one, I'll identify the type\nof conflict and suggest an appropriate intervention approach.\n\nAfter each scenario, provide feedback on my classification and intervention\nsuggestion. If I'm wrong, explain why and what I missed.\n\nMake the scenarios progressively more complex—start easy, end with\nambiguous situations where multiple interpretations are valid.\n\nBegin with Scenario 1.\nWhat Happens: Progressive difficulty builds confidence and competence. Students move from obvious cases to nuanced judgment calls.\n\n\n\n5.7.5 Use Case 3: Exam Preparation\nStudent Prompt:\nCreate a practice exam for me based on the topics we've covered in my\nWorkplace Conflict Resolution unit.\n\nInclude:\n- 10 multiple choice questions (4 options each)\n- 3 short-answer questions (each requiring 150-200 word response)\n- 1 case study with 4 analysis questions\n\nTopics to cover:\n- Conflict theory (Thomas-Kilmann, interest-based bargaining)\n- Investigation processes\n- Mediation approaches\n- Legal requirements (procedural fairness, natural justice)\n\nAfter I complete the exam, grade my answers and provide detailed feedback\non what I got right/wrong and why.\nWhat Happens: Students can generate multiple practice exams with different questions each time. They enter the real exam having practiced extensively.\n\n\n\n5.7.6 Use Case 4: Targeted Remediation\nLecturer Prompt (to create remediation resource):\nI have students who struggled with understanding procedural fairness in\nworkplace investigations. Many think it just means \"being nice\" and don't\nunderstand the specific legal requirements.\n\nCreate a 10-question diagnostic quiz that tests whether students understand:\n1. The right to be informed of allegations\n2. The right to respond to allegations\n3. The requirement for impartial decision-making\n4. The requirement to consider the response before deciding\n5. The right to representation/support\n\nFor each question, use a scenario format. After each answer, provide\nimmediate teaching feedback explaining the principle, not just whether\nthey're right or wrong.\n\nGenerate the quiz.\nWhat You Get: A targeted remediation tool that teaches while testing. Students who failed your assessment can use this to identify and fix their knowledge gaps.\n\n\n\n5.7.7 Teaching Tip: How to Integrate This\nOption 1: Recommended Practice (Ungraded)\nIn your unit outline: &gt; “Before each assessment, I recommend using AI to generate practice questions and scenarios. Spend 30-60 minutes testing yourself until you feel confident. This is optional but strongly encouraged.”\nOption 2: Required Pre-Assessment Activity (Low Stakes)\n\n“Before the Week 8 exam, complete a self-generated practice test (minimum 20 questions). Submit a screenshot showing completion and a 100-word reflection: What did you learn from this practice? What areas do you still need to review?”\n\nWorth 5% of final grade—graded on completion and reflection quality, not on how many they got right.\nOption 3: Study Group Activity\n\n“In your study groups, use AI to generate practice scenarios. Each person generates 5 scenarios and tests the group. Discuss answers and explanations together.”\n\nCombines AI efficiency with peer learning.\n\n\n\n5.7.8 Critical Principle: Formative, Not Summative\nImportant: This technique is for practice, not for graded assessment.\nWhy? - Students can regenerate until they get “good” questions they already know answers to - AI-generated questions lack the rigor of carefully designed exam questions - Students need to struggle and make mistakes in low-stakes practice\nThe value: Unlimited, personalised practice that builds confidence and competence before high-stakes assessment.\n\n\n\n5.7.9 Variation: Adaptive Difficulty\nAdvanced Student Prompt:\nI want to practice identifying workplace bullying vs. performance management\nvs. legitimate reasonable management action.\n\nCreate scenarios for me to classify. After each one:\n- If I get it right, make the next scenario more nuanced and ambiguous\n- If I get it wrong, make the next scenario clearer and more obvious\n- Continue until I can correctly identify 5 difficult/ambiguous cases in a row\n\nTrack my progress and tell me when I've achieved mastery.\n\nBegin.\nThis creates a personalised learning path—AI adjusts difficulty based on student performance.\n\n\n\n5.7.10 Why This Matters\nTraditional practice is limited by: - Finite textbook questions - Lecturer time to create practice materials - Inability to provide immediate feedback at scale\nAI removes these constraints: - Infinite practice scenarios - Instant generation - Immediate feedback - Adaptive difficulty\nResult: Students can practice until they achieve mastery, not until they run out of practice problems.\n\n\n\n5.7.11 Simulating Adaptive Difficulty\nWhile true adaptive AI systems require technical infrastructure, students can manually create adaptive difficulty through smart prompting:\nStudent Prompt: Self-Directed Progression\nI want to practice identifying workplace bullying vs. legitimate performance\nmanagement vs. reasonable management action.\n\nGenerate scenarios for me to classify. After I answer each one, tell me if\nI'm correct.\n\nTrack my performance. When I get 8 out of 10 correct, automatically make\nthe next batch of scenarios more complex and ambiguous. When I get fewer\nthan 5 out of 10 correct, make the next batch clearer and more obvious.\n\nContinue until I can correctly identify 5 difficult, ambiguous cases in a row.\n\nBegin with Scenario 1 at medium difficulty.\nWhat This Achieves: - Student-controlled difficulty progression - Mastery-based advancement - Builds confidence through appropriate challenge - No technical setup required—just good prompting\nTeaching Tip:\nEncourage students to track their progress: &gt; “Before your next exam, use AI to practice until you achieve 90% accuracy on hard scenarios. Submit a screenshot showing your progression and a 100-word reflection on what you learned.”\nThis creates accountability without requiring sophisticated adaptive systems.",

    "section": "5.8 Technique 7: The Expert Panel (for Multi-Perspective Analysis)",
    "text": "5.8 Technique 7: The Expert Panel (for Multi-Perspective Analysis)\n\n5.8.1 What It Does\nStudents consult multiple AI “experts” with different theoretical or professional perspectives on the same HR problem, then synthesize the competing advice into a strategic recommendation.\n\n\n5.8.2 Why It Works for HR\nHR problems rarely have single “correct” answers. They exist at the intersection of psychology, law, business strategy, and ethics. This technique forces students to consider legitimate but competing perspectives and make informed choices about priorities and trade-offs.\n\n\n5.8.3 The Student Prompt (Ready to Use)\nI need to address high turnover in our sales department (35% annual turnover;\nindustry average is 18%). This is affecting team morale, increasing\nrecruitment costs, and impacting customer relationships.\n\nCreate three expert personas who will each analyse this problem from their\nprofessional perspective:\n\n**Expert 1: Organisational Psychologist**\nFocus on: Employee motivation, job satisfaction, workplace culture, team\ndynamics, psychological contracts\n\n**Expert 2: Compensation & Benefits Specialist**\nFocus on: Pay equity, market competitiveness, incentive structures, total\nrewards, cost-benefit analysis\n\n**Expert 3: Talent Management Strategist**\nFocus on: Career development, succession planning, retention programs,\nemployee value proposition, organisational capability\n\nHave each expert independently provide:\n1. Their diagnosis of why turnover is high (from their perspective)\n2. Their recommended intervention strategy\n3. Potential risks or limitations of their recommended approach\n4. What data they would need to validate their hypothesis\n\nAfter all three experts have provided their analysis, I will synthesize\ntheir recommendations and develop my own strategic recommendation.\n\nBegin with Expert 1: Organisational Psychologist.\n\n\n5.8.4 What Happens\nThe AI creates three distinct voices:\nOrganizational Psychologist: &gt; “The 35% turnover suggests a breakdown in psychological contract or poor person-organization fit. Sales roles are inherently stressful, but this level suggests systemic issues—possibly unrealistic targets, poor management relationships, or lack of autonomy. I recommend: (1) Conduct stay/exit interview analysis focusing on psychological factors, (2) Assess manager-employee relationship quality, (3) Review goal-setting processes…”\nCompensation Specialist: &gt; “At 35% turnover, you’re likely seeing pay inequity or uncompetitive base/commission structures. Sales talent is mobile and market-driven. I recommend: (1) Conduct compensation benchmarking against competitors, (2) Analyse pay dispersion within the team, (3) Review commission structures for fairness and achievability…”\nTalent Management Strategist: &gt; “High turnover in sales suggests limited growth opportunities or unclear career paths. Top performers leave when they plateau. I recommend: (1) Map career progression pathways, (2) Implement mentoring for high-potentials, (3) Create lateral development opportunities…”\n\n\n5.8.5 The Follow-Up Task\nAfter receiving all three perspectives, students must:\n\nCompare and Contrast:\n\nWhere do the experts agree?\nWhere do they conflict?\nWhich diagnosis seems most plausible given the evidence?\n\nSynthesize:\n\n“If I could only implement one intervention, which would have the most impact?”\n“How could I combine elements from multiple recommendations?”\n“What’s the minimum viable intervention that addresses multiple root causes?”\n\nJustify with Theory:\n\n“Which HR theory best explains my chosen approach?” (e.g., Herzberg’s two-factor theory, social exchange theory, expectancy theory)\n“What evidence would I need to collect to validate my choice?”\n\nAcknowledge Trade-offs:\n\n“What am I deprioritizing by choosing this approach?”\n“What are the risks if my diagnosis is wrong?”\n\n\n\n\n5.8.6 Variations for Different Topics\nVariation 1: Policy Design\nThree experts debate a proposed \"Bring Your Own Device\" policy:\n- IT Security Officer (focus: data protection, cybersecurity)\n- HR Manager (focus: employee experience, equity, privacy)\n- CFO (focus: cost savings, business case, ROI)\n\nEach argues for their priorities. Student must design a policy that\nbalances all three perspectives.\nVariation 2: Ethical Dilemma\nThree experts analyse whether to implement mandatory return-to-office:\n- Employee Relations Specialist (focus: morale, retention, fairness)\n- Operations Manager (focus: productivity, collaboration, efficiency)\n- Legal Counsel (focus: contractual obligations, discrimination risk, WHS)\n\nStudent must recommend a policy that is ethical, legal, and operationally sound.\nVariation 3: Change Management\nThree experts advise on implementing AI resume screening:\n- Diversity & Inclusion Officer (focus: algorithmic bias, equity)\n- Recruitment Lead (focus: efficiency, candidate experience)\n- Risk & Compliance Manager (focus: legal compliance, audit trails)\n\nStudent must design an implementation plan that addresses all concerns.\n\n\n5.8.7 Teaching Tip: Assessment Application\nAssignment: Multi-Expert Consultation Report\nStudent Requirements: 1. Generate consultation with 3 experts on an assigned HR problem 2. Submit full transcript of expert advice 3. Write 1000-word synthesis report including: - Summary of each expert’s position - Analysis of agreements and conflicts - Your strategic recommendation with justification - Theoretical framework supporting your choice - Implementation risks and mitigation strategies\nWhat You’re Assessing: - Ability to understand multiple valid perspectives - Synthesis and integration skills - Strategic decision-making under ambiguity - Application of HR theory to justify choices - Recognition of trade-offs and constraints\n\n\n5.8.8 Why This Is Powerful\nMost HR teaching presents one “correct” approach. But professional practice requires navigating competing legitimate perspectives.\nThis technique teaches: - No single expert has the complete answer - Good HR decisions balance multiple priorities - Strategic thinking means choosing which perspective to prioritize when - Justification matters more than the specific choice - Real problems require synthesis, not just analysis\n\n\n5.8.9 Combining with Other Techniques\nExpert Panel works brilliantly with:\nPros and Cons (Technique 2): &gt; “After consulting the expert panel, use the Pros and Cons technique to evaluate each expert’s recommended intervention systematically.”\nDebating (Technique 5): &gt; “Have the three experts debate each other’s recommendations. Then you arbitrate and make the final decision.”\nRole Play (Technique 4): &gt; “After developing your strategy based on expert consultation, role-play presenting it to a skeptical stakeholder (CFO, union rep, CEO) and defend your choices.”",

The challenge or conflict 4. Behavioural guidelines for the AI 5. When the simulation should end\n\n6.4.1 Setup Prompt (Ready to Use)\nYou are Alex Chen, a 32-year-old software engineer who has worked at\nTechCorp for three years. You were a high performer until six months ago,\nwhen your work quality declined noticeably.\n\nBACKGROUND CONTEXT:\n- You have missed three project deadlines in the past four months\n- Your code quality has dropped—recent pull requests have had multiple bugs\n  that QA caught\n- You've been arriving late to work 2-3 times per week\n- Your manager has already had one informal conversation with you about\n  these concerns two months ago, but things have not improved\n- You are being placed on a formal 60-day Performance Improvement Plan (PIP)\n\nYOUR PERSONA AND BEHAVIOR:\n- You are defensive and embarrassed. You feel this PIP is unfair and harsh.\n- You believe your recent work is \"good enough\" and that your manager has\n  unrealistic expectations\n- You are dealing with a stressful personal situation (caring for an aging\n  parent), but you have not told your manager about this—you believe it's\n  private and not relevant to work\n- You are not aggressive or hostile, but you are resistant and will push\n  back on criticism\n- If the HR person or manager shows genuine empathy and asks open questions,\n  you will gradually reveal some personal context\n- If they are accusatory or dismissive, you will shut down and become\n  minimal in your responses\n\nTHE MEETING:\nI am the HR representative (or the manager) conducting the PIP meeting with\nyou. This is a formal meeting. You have just been told this is a PIP\ndiscussion.\n\nYOUR GOAL:\n- React as Alex would realistically react\n- Challenge the fairness of the process if it seems rushed or poorly\n  explained\n- Reveal personal information only if trust is established\n- Show emotion (frustration, stress, worry) but remain professional\n- Respond dynamically to how I conduct the meeting\n\nStay in character throughout. Begin the meeting by responding to my opening\nstatement. I will start the conversation now.\nKey Design Elements: - Complexity: Alex isn’t purely defensive or purely cooperative—there’s legitimate work performance decline and extenuating circumstances - Realistic emotion: Alex is stressed and embarrassed, not theatrical or extreme - Conditional behavior: How Alex responds depends on the student’s approach (rewards good technique) - Hidden information: The personal context isn’t revealed unless the student asks the right questions with the right tone",

    "text": "6.5 Phase 2: The Simulation\nThe student now conducts the meeting. Here’s an example of how this might play out.\n\n6.5.1 Example Conversation\nStudent (HR Rep): &gt; “Hi Alex, thanks for meeting with me. I want to talk with you today about some performance concerns that have been raised. I know this is a difficult conversation, but I want to make sure we have an open discussion about what’s been happening and how we can support you moving forward.”\nAI (as Alex): &gt; shifts uncomfortably “Yeah, I’ve been hearing whispers about this. Look, I know I’ve missed a couple of deadlines, but I don’t think things are as bad as people are making out. I’m still getting my work done. Is this really necessary?”\nStudent: &gt; “I understand this feels uncomfortable. Let me be specific about the concerns. Over the past four months, you’ve missed three major project deadlines—the payment gateway integration in March, the API update in April, and the mobile optimization in May. Additionally, QA has flagged an increase in bugs in your recent code submissions. These are measurable changes from your previous performance standard. Can you help me understand what’s been happening?”\nAI (as Alex): &gt; pauses, looks down “I mean… yeah, okay, I’ve had some issues. But deadlines get missed sometimes, right? And bugs happen. I just feel like everyone’s being really harsh all of a sudden. I had one conversation with my manager about this two months ago, and now suddenly I’m on a PIP? That feels pretty extreme.”\nStudent: &gt; “That’s a fair question, Alex. You did have an informal conversation with your manager in early April where these concerns were raised. At that time, you both agreed on some strategies to get things back on track. Since then, we’ve continued to see the same patterns—another deadline missed last month and continued quality issues. A PIP isn’t a punishment; it’s a structured way to clearly define expectations, provide support, and give you a fair opportunity to improve. Does that make sense?”\nAI (as Alex): &gt; sighs “I guess. I just… it’s been a really tough few months personally, okay? I know that’s not your problem, but it’s not like I’m just slacking off or don’t care anymore.”\nStudent: &gt; “Thank you for sharing that, Alex. I appreciate that personal circumstances can affect work, and I’m genuinely sorry you’re dealing with difficult things. If there are specific supports we can offer—whether that’s adjustments to your schedule, access to our Employee Assistance Program, or other accommodations—we’re open to discussing that. But we also need to be clear about the performance standards that need to be met. Can we talk about what support might help you succeed during this PIP period?”\nAI (as Alex): &gt; softens slightly “Honestly, I’ve been dealing with my dad’s health declining. I’ve been having to take him to medical appointments, and I’m the only family member nearby. Some mornings I’m exhausted because I’ve been up half the night. I didn’t want to bring it into work because… I don’t know, I thought I could just handle it.”\nStudent: &gt; “I’m really sorry to hear about your father, Alex. That’s incredibly stressful. I’m glad you’ve told me, because this is exactly the kind of situation where we want to support our employees. Have you considered whether a temporary flexible schedule might help—perhaps starting later on days when you have early appointments, or adjusting your hours? We can also connect you with our EAP, which offers counseling and support for family caregivers. Would either of those be helpful?”\nAI (as Alex): &gt; nods “Yeah… actually, that might really help. I didn’t know that was an option. I’ve just been trying to power through, but clearly that’s not working.”\nStudent: &gt; “I appreciate your honesty. So here’s what I suggest: we’ll document this PIP with clear performance targets—specific deadlines and quality standards. But we’ll also document the support measures we’re putting in place, including flexible scheduling where possible. This gives you the structure and the support to get back to the high performance standard we know you’re capable of. The PIP period is 60 days. At the 30-day mark, we’ll have a check-in to see how things are going. Does that sound fair?”\nAI (as Alex): &gt; takes a breath “Okay. Yeah. I mean, it’s still stressful to be on a PIP, but I get it. And if I can actually get some flexibility with the schedule, that would help a lot. I don’t want to lose this job—I just need to get things back on track.”\nStudent: &gt; “That’s exactly the goal, Alex. We want you to succeed. Let’s schedule a follow-up meeting next week to formalize the flexible schedule arrangement and go through the detailed PIP document. Thank you for being open with me today—that’s really important.”\nAI (as Alex): &gt; manages a small, tired smile “Thanks. I appreciate you actually listening.”",

COMMUNICATION EFFECTIVENESS\n   - Was the tone appropriate (professional, empathetic but not dismissive)?\n   - Did the student use open questions to encourage dialogue?\n   - How did they handle Alex's defensiveness?\n   - Did they actively listen and acknowledge Alex's concerns?\n\n3. LEGAL AND ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS\n   - Did the student avoid any discriminatory language or assumptions?\n   - Did they appropriately handle the disclosure of personal circumstances?\n   - Did they maintain appropriate professional boundaries?\n   - Did they document support measures as well as performance requirements?\n\n4. APPLICATION OF HR THEORY\n   - What motivational or psychological principles did the student apply\n     (or fail to apply)?\n   - How well did they balance accountability with support?\n   - Did they create conditions for behavioural change?\n\nFor each criterion, provide:\n- A score out of 10\n- Specific examples from the transcript (quote the student's words)\n- What the student did well\n- What the student could improve\n- One concrete suggestion for how to improve\n\nFinally, provide an overall assessment: If this were a real PIP meeting,\nwhat would likely happen next based on how the student conducted it?\n\nHere is the transcript:\n\n[PASTE TRANSCRIPT HERE]\n\nBegin your critique.\n\n\n6.6.2 Example Critique Output\nThe AI will provide something like this:\n\nCRITIQUE OF PIP MEETING PERFORMANCE\n1. PROCEDURAL FAIRNESS: 9/10\nWhat you did well: You were exemplary in providing specific, measurable examples of performance concerns. When you said, “Over the past four months, you’ve missed three major project deadlines—the payment gateway integration in March, the API update in April, and the mobile optimization in May,” you gave Alex concrete information to respond to, not vague accusations. This is critical for procedural fairness.\nYou also clearly explained the purpose of the PIP: “A PIP isn’t a punishment; it’s a structured way to clearly define expectations, provide support, and give you a fair opportunity to improve.” This reframing helped reduce Alex’s defensiveness.\nWhere you could improve: You could have been even more explicit about the timeline and previous feedback. While you mentioned the April conversation, you could have said: “We had a conversation on April 3rd where we documented three specific concerns. We agreed you would [specific actions]. Since then, we’ve seen [specific outcomes]. That’s why we’re now moving to a formal PIP.”\nSuggestion: Always reference specific dates and documented prior warnings. This strengthens the legal defensibility of your process.\n\n2. COMMUNICATION EFFECTIVENESS: 10/10\nWhat you did well: Your use of empathy was outstanding. When Alex revealed personal stress, you immediately acknowledged it: “Thank you for sharing that, Alex. I appreciate that personal circumstances can affect work, and I’m genuinely sorry you’re dealing with difficult things.” This response validated Alex’s feelings while maintaining professional boundaries.\nYou also used excellent open-ended questions: “Can you help me understand what’s been happening?” This invited dialogue rather than putting Alex on the defensive.\nYour handling of defensiveness was textbook-perfect. When Alex said the PIP felt “extreme,” you didn’t argue or dismiss—you acknowledged the concern (“That’s a fair question”) and then explained the rationale.\nWhere you could improve: Nothing significant. Your communication was professional, empathetic, and effective throughout.\n\n3. LEGAL AND ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS: 9/10\nWhat you did well: When Alex disclosed caregiving responsibilities, you immediately offered accommodations: “Have you considered whether a temporary flexible schedule might help?” This is legally and ethically sound—you’re demonstrating that the company is willing to make reasonable adjustments, which protects against claims of unfair dismissal or discrimination.\nYou also avoided making assumptions or probing inappropriately into Alex’s personal life. You accepted the disclosure, offered support, and moved the conversation forward professionally.\nWhere you could improve: You should explicitly document this conversation. At the end of the meeting, you could have said: “I’m going to document today’s conversation, including your disclosure about your father’s health and the flexible schedule accommodation we’ve discussed. You’ll receive a copy of this documentation for your records.”\nSuggestion: Always verbally confirm that documentation will be provided. This ensures transparency and gives the employee a chance to correct any misunderstandings immediately.\n\n4. APPLICATION OF HR THEORY: 8/10\nWhat you did well: You demonstrated understanding of motivational theory by balancing challenge with support. You didn’t just impose standards—you co-created solutions by asking, “Can we talk about what support might help you succeed during this PIP period?”\nYou also applied principles of procedural justice by ensuring Alex felt heard and treated fairly, which research shows increases acceptance of difficult decisions.\nWhere you could improve: You could have applied goal-setting theory more explicitly. When finalising the PIP, you mentioned “clear performance targets,” but you didn’t collaboratively define them in the meeting. Research shows that when employees participate in setting their own goals, commitment and achievement increase.\nSuggestion: In your follow-up meeting, involve Alex in defining the specific, measurable targets for the PIP. For example: “What do you think is a realistic number of on-time deliverables over the next 30 days, given the support we’re putting in place?” This increases ownership and reduces resistance.\n\nOVERALL ASSESSMENT\nLikely Outcome: Based on how you conducted this meeting, Alex is likely to: - Feel that the process was fair, even though it’s stressful - Engage constructively with the PIP rather than resist or disengage - Utilise the flexible schedule accommodation - Have a reasonable chance of meeting the performance standards during the 60-day period\nWhy: You established psychological safety (Alex felt safe disclosing personal information), you demonstrated empathy without compromising standards, and you offered concrete support. This is exactly the balance effective HR professionals must strike.\nOne Risk to Watch: Ensure that the flexible schedule accommodation is documented and approved by the manager. If the manager later claims they weren’t consulted or don’t agree, this could create conflict. Always confirm that proposed accommodations are feasible with all stakeholders before committing to them in a meeting.\n\nFINAL SCORE: 36/40 (90%)\nThis was a highly competent performance. You demonstrated strong communication skills, applied HR principles effectively, and handled a complex, emotionally charged situation with professionalism and empathy. The areas for improvement are minor and relate to documentation and collaborative goal-setting—both easily addressed in your follow-up meeting.",

In professional development, repetition until competence is exactly what we want. However, you can require students to submit all attempts, not just their best one. This shows their learning journey and prevents gaming the system.\nQ: What if students share their transcripts and just copy each other’s approach?\nA: Design the scenarios with variability. Give each student a slightly different context (different employee persona, different performance issue, different complicating factor). The skills they’re practicing remain the same, but the conversations will be unique.\nQ: How do I know the AI’s critique is accurate?\nA: You should review a sample of critiques initially to ensure quality. However, because you write the critique prompt with specific criteria tied to your learning objectives, the AI’s assessment will align with your rubric. You’re essentially scaling your own assessment criteria.\nQ: Can students do this with voice instead of text?\nA: Yes! Many AI tools now support voice conversation mode. Students can literally speak their way through the simulation, making it even more realistic. The conversation can then be transcribed for the critique phase.",

    "text": "7.5 What This Looks Like in Practice\n\n7.5.1 Student’s First Draft (Excerpt)\n\n“This scenario shows a conflict between Maria and David. The main issue is that David is not being a good manager. Maria feels like she’s being treated unfairly, which is creating a hostile work environment. This could be bullying or harassment. The HR department should investigate by talking to both Maria and David to get both sides of the story. They should also implement conflict resolution training for David. If this isn’t handled, it could lead to a lawsuit or Maria quitting.”\n\n\n\n7.5.2 AI Feedback (Using the Prompt Above)\nFORMATIVE FEEDBACK ON DRAFT\nCRITERION 1: Issue Identification - Score: 2/4\nYou’ve identified the surface-level conflict, but your analysis lacks specificity and misses critical issues.\nWhat you wrote: “This could be bullying or harassment.”\nThe problem: You’ve used these terms interchangeably, but they have different legal definitions and implications. Bullying is repeated, unreasonable behavior; harassment typically relates to discrimination based on protected characteristics (gender, race, age, etc.). Which applies here, and why? Is there evidence of discrimination based on Maria’s gender or another protected characteristic, or is this a management style issue?\nWhat’s missing: You haven’t identified potential procedural issues (why wasn’t this addressed earlier?), power dynamics (David is Maria’s manager), or organisational culture problems (two other employees find his style “difficult”).\n\nCRITERION 2: Investigation Process - Score: 2/4\nYou’ve identified the need for an investigation, but your description is too vague.\nWhat you wrote: “Talking to both Maria and David to get both sides of the story.”\nThe problem: A fair investigation requires more than just hearing “both sides.” You need to: - Interview the two employees who informally raised concerns - Review any documented evidence (emails, performance reviews, meeting notes) - Examine whether other team leaders received opportunities Maria was denied - Maintain confidentiality and impartiality throughout - Document everything\nWhat’s missing: Any mention of procedural fairness, natural justice, or legal compliance in the investigation process.\n\nCRITERION 3: Legal/Policy Application - Score: 1/4\nThis is your weakest area. You haven’t applied any specific legal principles or policies.\nWhat you wrote: “This could lead to a lawsuit.”\nThe problem: This is too vague. What kind of lawsuit? Under what legal theory? You need to reference specific legal risks like: - Potential discrimination claim under the Fair Work Act (if there’s evidence David’s treatment relates to a protected characteristic) - Potential bullying claim under work health and safety legislation - Potential breach of the employer’s duty of care\nYou also need to reference the organization’s obligations—to provide a safe workplace, to investigate complaints fairly, to act on findings.\n\nCRITERION 4: Theoretical Integration - Score: 1/4\nYou have not applied any psychological theory to your analysis.\nWhat’s missing entirely: There’s no reference to conflict resolution theory, organisational justice theory, motivation theory, or any framework that would explain why this situation is problematic beyond “it’s unfair.” For example: - Organisational justice theory explains why Maria perceives inequity - Conflict resolution models would guide your intervention choice - Leadership or management theory could inform what training David might need\n\nCRITERION 5: Risk Analysis - Score: 2/4\nYou’ve identified two risks (lawsuit, resignation) but your analysis is shallow.\nWhat you wrote: “This could lead to a lawsuit or Maria quitting.”\nThe problem: These are possible outcomes, but you haven’t explained why or how they might occur, or what other risks exist: - Reputational damage if other employees witness inaction - Decreased team morale and productivity - Potential for retaliation against Maria if not handled carefully - Liability if the organisation knew about the problem and didn’t act\n\nCRITERION 6: Writing Quality - Score: 3/4\nYour writing is clear and easy to follow, which is good. However, it’s quite informal for a professional HR analysis (“not being a good manager”). Use more precise, professional language.\n\nSTRONGEST ASPECT: You correctly identified that this requires formal investigation and that there are consequences for inaction. You’ve grasped the seriousness of the situation.\nWEAKEST ASPECT: Complete lack of theoretical integration and very weak legal/policy analysis. You’re describing the problem but not demonstrating deep HR knowledge or analytical skill.\n\nTHREE SPECIFIC ACTIONS FOR REVISION:\n\nAdd legal specificity: Research and cite at least two specific legal principles or obligations that apply here (e.g., employer’s duty to provide a safe workplace under WHS legislation, prohibition of workplace bullying, Fair Work Act provisions on adverse action). Explain how these apply to the scenario.\nIntegrate theory: Choose one psychological or organisational theory (e.g., organisational justice theory, Adams’ equity theory, or conflict resolution models) and explicitly use it to explain why Maria is experiencing the situation as unfair and/or to justify your recommended intervention.\nDetail the investigation: Expand your investigation section to list at least five specific steps the HR team should take, including who should be interviewed, what documents should be reviewed, and how to ensure procedural fairness.\n\nCURRENT ESTIMATED SCORE: 11/24 (46%)\nThis draft needs substantial development before submission. Focus on the three actions above and your score will improve significantly.",

Because students have had the chance to improve with AI feedback, you should see much higher quality work overall.\nDimension 2: Quality of Learning Process (30%) Assess their reflection: - Did they engage meaningfully with the AI feedback? - Did they make substantive revisions? - Do they show metacognitive awareness (understanding of their own learning)? - Did they critically evaluate the AI’s suggestions or just accept them blindly?\nKey Question for Dimension 2: “Did the student just ask AI to write it for them, or did they use AI to learn how to write better?”\n\n\n7.7.2 Red Flags for AI Misuse\nIf a student: - Shows no evidence of revision between drafts - Can’t explain in their reflection what they changed or why - Submits work that’s suddenly far beyond their previous capability with no learning process shown - Has AI feedback that’s generic (suggesting they didn’t actually use your provided prompt)\n…then you have grounds for a conversation about academic integrity.\nBut the transparency model makes genuine misuse much harder, because students have to show their working.",

Where did they disagree? Which feedback was most helpful and why?\nThis teaches critical evaluation of feedback sources—an important professional skill.\n\n\n7.8.3 Variation 3: AI Critique Challenge\nAfter receiving AI feedback, students must: - Identify one piece of feedback they disagree with - Argue why the AI is wrong or has misunderstood their work - Provide evidence for their position\nThis prevents students from blindly accepting AI suggestions and develops critical thinking about AI limitations.",

Students who genuinely engage with feedback and revise their thinking will show that in their reflection. Students who just prompt-engineer to get a high score without learning will have nothing meaningful to say about what they learned.\n“What if the AI gives them incorrect feedback?”\nThis is actually a valuable learning opportunity. If the AI makes an error (e.g., misapplies a legal principle), students who know their material will catch it and can challenge it in their reflection. This demonstrates higher-order thinking.\nAlso, because you’re providing the critique prompt, you control the assessment criteria. The AI is applying your rubric, so it should align with your expectations.\n“Isn’t this just making things easier for students?”\nNo—it’s making feedback faster and more accessible, but the cognitive work hasn’t changed. Students still need to understand the concepts, apply theory correctly, and demonstrate critical thinking. The AI just accelerates the feedback loop so they can learn faster.\nIn fact, this model often reveals students who’ve been hiding behind vague writing—the AI forces them to be specific and substantive.\n“What about students who don’t have access to AI tools?”\nIf equity is a concern, you can: - Provide access to AI tools through the university (many institutions now have educational subscriptions) - Run the AI critique process in class or during office hours - Make the AI feedback optional but provide other scaffolding for students who don’t use it",

    "text": "8.3 The Three-Part Framework for Ethical AI Use\nThis framework works for talking to students, colleagues, and administrators. It has three components:\n\n8.3.1 1. Transparency (Not Prohibition)\nThe principle: Make AI use explicit, expected, and assessable rather than hidden and policed.\nIn practice: - Tell students exactly when and how they can use AI - Provide the prompts and tools yourself - Assess their use of AI, not their avoidance of AI - Reward students who identify AI’s errors and limitations\nWhy this builds integrity: When AI use is transparent, students learn to use it openly and responsibly. When it’s prohibited, students use it secretly and don’t develop critical oversight skills.\n\n\n8.3.2 2. Critical Oversight (Not Blind Reliance)\nThe principle: Teach students that AI is a tool requiring human judgment, not an authority to be trusted.\nIn practice: - Design assignments where students must critique or override AI outputs - Require students to identify what AI gets wrong - Grade students on their ability to improve on AI suggestions - Show examples of AI failures (bias, errors, oversimplification)\nWhy this builds integrity: Students learn that using AI thoughtfully is harder than avoiding it. They develop the professional habit of verification and critical thinking.\n\n\n8.3.3 3. Professional Relevance (Not Academic Abstraction)\nThe principle: Connect AI use in coursework to AI use in professional practice.\nIn practice: - Frame assignments as professional scenarios: “You’re the HR manager using AI to draft a policy…” - Discuss workplace AI ethics: “What happens if your AI resume screening tool discriminates?” - Teach governance: “Who is accountable when AI-assisted decisions go wrong?” - Include AI literacy as a stated learning objective in your unit outline\nWhy this builds integrity: When students see AI use as professional skill development rather than academic shortcut, they engage differently.

Some of you are probably already using ChatGPT or similar tools. Some of you are worried that using AI is cheating. Some of you are wondering if I’m going to try to detect and punish AI use.\nHere’s my position: AI tools exist, and you’ll use them in HR jobs. My job is to teach you to use them wisely and ethically.\nIn this unit, we’ll use AI openly in some assignments. You’ll learn when AI is helpful, when it’s risky, and when human judgment must override AI recommendations. That’s a professional skill.\nI’m not interested in playing ‘gotcha’ with AI detection software. I’m interested in whether you can think critically, justify your decisions, and demonstrate competent HR practice. If you can do that with AI assistance, great. If you use AI to avoid thinking, I’ll know—because your work won’t demonstrate understanding.\nQuestions or concerns about this approach?”\n\nWhy this works: - Sets a clear, positive tone - Positions you as a guide, not a cop - Acknowledges student anxiety - Makes professional relevance explicit - Invites dialogue",

    "text": "8.5 Designing “Integrity-Resistant” Assignments\nSome assignments are easier to misuse with AI than others. Here’s how to design assessments that are inherently resistant to misuse:\n\n8.5.1 Principle 1: Assess Process, Not Just Product\nVulnerable design: “Write a 1500-word essay analysing a workplace conflict.” - Student can paste this into AI and submit the output\nIntegrity-resistant design: “Conduct a simulated investigation interview (submit transcript), then audit your own process against procedural fairness criteria.” - Student must engage in real-time conversation (can’t be pre-written) - Assessment focuses on methodology visible in transcript - Self-audit requires metacognitive engagement\n\n\n8.5.2 Principle 2: Require Evidence of Thinking\nVulnerable design: “Recommend a solution to this HR problem.” - AI can generate a plausible recommendation\nIntegrity-resistant design: “AI generated three solutions to this problem [provide them]. Critique each option, identify which one is best and why, and explain what the AI got wrong.” - Student must think beyond what AI provided - Requires critical evaluation, not just generation - Makes AI outputs the starting point, not the end point\n\n\n8.5.3 Principle 3: Make Personal Context Essential\nVulnerable design: “Analyse the pros and cons of flexible work policies.” - Generic question AI can answer generally\nIntegrity-resistant design: “Based on your conversation with the AI employee ‘Jamie’ (from your Week 4 simulation), analyse what flexible work approach would address Jamie’s specific situation while meeting organisational needs.” - Requires integration of previous personalised work - Context is unique to each student - Generic AI response won’t fit\n\n\n8.5.4 Principle 4: Assess Revision and Iteration\nVulnerable design: Submit final work only - No visibility into how it was created\nIntegrity-resistant design: Submit first draft, AI feedback received, revised draft, and reflection on changes made - Process is visible and assessable - Shows learning trajectory - Difficult to fake iterative improvement\n\n\n8.5.5 Principle 5: Require Justification of Choices\nVulnerable design: “Create a recruitment interview guide.” - AI can generate a complete guide\nIntegrity-resistant design: “Create an interview guide. For each question, justify why you chose it, what competency it targets, and what poor response would sound like. Identify two questions the AI generated that you rejected and explain why they were inadequate.” - Requires deep understanding, not just production - Student must demonstrate judgment beyond AI capability - Reveals whether they understand what they’re submitting",

Here’s how to identify and respond:\n\n8.6.1 Red Flag 1: Sudden Quality Shift\nWhat you see: Student whose previous work was weak suddenly submits sophisticated analysis.\nResponse approach: - Don’t immediately accuse. There could be legitimate reasons (they got help from writing center, they finally understood the concept, etc.) - Ask questions: “Your analysis has improved significantly. Can you walk me through your thinking process on this particular section?” - Request elaboration: “This point about organisational justice theory is interesting. Can you explain how you see it applying to this specific scenario?”\nIf genuine learning: They can explain their thinking. If inappropriate AI use: They struggle to explain or elaborate.\n\n\n8.6.2 Red Flag 2: Work That Doesn’t Match Assignment Context\nWhat you see: Student used generic AI response that doesn’t fit the specific scenario or constraints you provided.\nExample: Assignment asked for Australian employment law context, student submitted response referencing US legislation.\nResponse approach: - Point out the mismatch: “I notice you’ve referenced Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, but this assignment requires Australian context. Can you explain how this applies to our scenario?” - Provide opportunity to revise: “I think you may have used a resource that wasn’t contextually appropriate. Please resubmit with correct jurisdictional references.”\nTeaching moment: Use this to discuss the importance of contextual verification when using AI tools professionally.\n\n\n8.6.3 Red Flag 3: No Evidence of Process in Process-Based Assessment\nWhat you see: Student submitted required components but shows no genuine engagement (e.g., self-audit identifies no mistakes, reflection is superficial).\nResponse approach: - Return for revision: “Your self-audit suggests your performance was perfect. Reflective practice requires identifying areas for growth. Please resubmit with honest self-assessment.” - Offer guidance: “Everyone makes mistakes in complex HR conversations. Look specifically at moments where the employee seemed frustrated or defensive—what might you have done differently?”\nTeaching moment: Explain that honest self-assessment is more valuable than false perfection.\n\n\n8.6.4 Red Flag 4: Can’t Explain or Defend Work in Person\nWhat you see: High-quality written submission, but student can’t discuss it in office hours or oral follow-up.\nResponse approach: - For high-stakes situations: Schedule a brief oral examination: “I’d like to discuss your assignment. Can you walk me through your main recommendation and why you chose it?” - Frame it as learning: “I was impressed by your analysis. I’d love to hear more about your thinking process.”\nIf inappropriate use is confirmed: - Follow university academic misconduct procedures - Use it as a teaching moment about professional accountability",

    "text": "8.7 Teaching AI Ethics Through HR Scenarios\nOne of the most powerful ways to address integrity is to make it a learning objective. Teach students to identify ethical problems with AI use through HR scenarios.\n\n8.7.1 Exercise 1: The Flawed AI Termination Memo\nAssignment:\n\n“Use AI to draft a termination letter for an employee being dismissed for poor performance after a 60-day PIP.\nThen conduct an ethical audit: - What did the AI include that could create legal risk? - What did the AI omit that’s legally required? - What tone or language choices are problematic? - How would you revise this to ensure procedural fairness?\nYour grade is based on how thoroughly you identify problems, not on the quality of AI’s original output.”\n\nWhat students learn: - AI can confidently generate legally dangerous content - They must verify and correct AI outputs - Professional accountability can’t be delegated to AI\n\n\n8.7.2 Exercise 2: The Biased Resume Screening Tool\nScenario:\n\n“Your company uses an AI resume screening tool. You notice that it consistently ranks candidates from certain universities higher and flags career gaps as negative. Three rejected candidates have complained that the process seems unfair.\nAs the HR manager: 1. What are the ethical concerns with this AI tool? 2. What’s your legal risk? 3. Who is accountable for the AI’s decisions—the vendor, the company, you personally? 4. What would you do to address this situation?”\n\nWhat students learn: - Algorithmic bias is a real professional issue - Using AI doesn’t eliminate human responsibility - HR professionals must advocate for fair processes even when technology is involved\n\n\n8.7.3 Exercise 3: The Over-Reliance Problem\nScenario:\n\n“You used AI to analyse exit interview data and generate recommendations for reducing turnover. You presented the AI’s recommendations to senior management, and they were implemented. Six months later, turnover has increased.\nReflection questions: 1. What might the AI have missed in its analysis? 2. What was your professional responsibility before presenting AI recommendations? 3. How do you explain this outcome to management? 4. What does this teach you about using AI in strategic decision-making?”\n\nWhat students learn: - AI analysis isn’t inherently correct - Professional judgment can’t be outsourced - They’re accountable for recommendations they present, regardless of how they were generated",

    "text": "8.8 Responding to Colleague and Administrator Concerns\nYou may need to justify your approach to colleagues or administrators who are skeptical about AI integration.\n\n8.8.1 Concern: “This undermines academic standards”\nResponse:\n\n“Actually, it raises standards. I’m no longer testing whether students can recall information—I’m testing whether they can apply it in realistic, dynamic scenarios. I’m assessing higher-order thinking: critical evaluation, professional judgment, and ethical reasoning. These are harder to demonstrate than memorization.”\n\n\n\n8.8.2 Concern: “How do you know they’re learning anything?”\nResponse:\n\n“I assess their process, not just their final product. I can see their thinking in conversation transcripts, in their critiques of AI outputs, and in their reflective analysis. When students can identify what AI got wrong and explain why, they’re demonstrating deep understanding.”\n\n\n\n8.8.3 Concern: “This doesn’t align with university academic integrity policies”\nResponse:\n\n“University policies typically prohibit unacknowledged or uncritical use of external sources. My approach makes AI use acknowledged and requires critical evaluation. Students aren’t hiding AI use—they’re demonstrating competent use. That’s consistent with academic integrity principles, just applied to a new tool.”\n\nSupporting evidence: - Many universities are updating policies to allow appropriate AI use - Professional accreditation bodies are recognizing AI literacy as essential - Employer expectations include ability to use AI tools responsibly\n\n\n8.8.4 Concern: “What if other lecturers don’t agree?”\nResponse:\n\n“That’s fine—pedagogical approaches can vary across units. I’m being transparent with students about expectations in my unit. If other lecturers prohibit AI use, students can follow those different expectations. Professional practice requires adapting to different contexts anyway—this models that.”",

Can they list the steps in a disciplinary process? Can they identify relevant legislation?\nThis is assessing product—the knowledge artifact.\nProcess-based approach: Watch the student conduct a disciplinary meeting. Did they actually demonstrate procedural fairness? Did they follow the correct process? Did they apply the legislation appropriately in real-time?\nThis is assessing process—the professional methodology.\nThe difference matters enormously. A student can memorize the definition of “active listening” and still conduct a terrible investigation interview. They can recite employment law and still make decisions that expose an organisation to legal risk.\nHR is a process profession. The value lies not in what you know, but in what you do with what you know—how you investigate, how you communicate, how you analyse evidence, how you make decisions under uncertainty.\nAI makes it possible, for the first time, to assess process at scale.",

    "text": "9.3 Assessment Model 1: Simulated HR Consultation and Process Audit\n\n9.3.1 Overview\nStudents conduct a simulated HR consultation (conversation with an AI persona) and then audit their own process against professional standards. The grade focuses on methodology, not outcome.\n\n\n9.3.2 Learning Objectives Assessed\n\nConduct fair, unbiased investigations\nDemonstrate effective communication and empathetic practices\nApply relevant legal and ethical rules in real-time\nEngage in reflective practice and self-assessment\n\n\n\n9.3.3 Assignment Structure\nPart 1: The Consultation (60% of grade)\nStudents receive a scenario prompt and conduct a 15-20 minute conversation with an AI persona representing an employee, manager, or stakeholder.\nExample Scenario: &gt; You are the HR representative meeting with Taylor Kim, an employee who has requested a formal meeting to discuss concerns about their working conditions. Taylor has been with the company for 3 years and has never raised concerns before. You don’t know what the specific issues are yet.\nStudents must navigate the conversation, uncover the issues, demonstrate appropriate HR process, and conclude the meeting professionally.\nPart 2: The Process Audit (40% of grade)\nStudents submit: 1. The full transcript of their conversation 2. A structured process audit document (template provided) where they: - Identify every point where they applied (or failed to apply) procedural fairness - Cite relevant legal principles or policies that guided their questions/responses - Note where they demonstrated (or failed to demonstrate) effective communication - Identify missed opportunities or mistakes - Explain what they would do differently\n\n\n9.3.4 The Process Audit Template\nThis is what students complete after the conversation:\nPROCESS AUDIT DOCUMENT\n\nSECTION 1: PROCEDURAL FAIRNESS ANALYSIS\n\nReview the transcript. For each of the following requirements of procedural\nfairness, provide:\n- A direct quote from the transcript showing where you demonstrated this\n- A score (1-5) for how well you did\n- What you could have done better\n\nRequirements:\n1. Did you clearly explain the purpose of the meeting?\n   Quote: _______\n   Self-Score: ___/5\n   Improvement: _______\n\n2. Did you give the employee adequate opportunity to speak and explain?\n   Quote: _______\n   Self-Score: ___/5\n   Improvement: _______\n\n3. Did you avoid making premature judgments or assumptions?\n   Quote: _______\n   Self-Score: ___/5\n   Improvement: _______\n\n[Continue for all procedural fairness elements...]\n\nSECTION 2: LEGAL AND ETHICAL APPLICATION\n\nIdentify at least 3 moments in the conversation where legal or ethical\nconsiderations were relevant.\n\nExample:\nMoment 1 (Quote): \"I asked Taylor if they'd be comfortable sharing whether\nany of this was related to health or personal circumstances.\"\n\nLegal/Ethical Principle: Right to privacy; must not compel disclosure of\nmedical information, but can invite voluntary disclosure to explore\naccommodation options.\n\nDid I handle this appropriately? Yes/No - Explain: _______\n\n[Continue for at least 3 moments...]\n\nSECTION 3: COMMUNICATION EFFECTIVENESS\n\nIdentify 2 examples where your communication was effective and explain why.\nIdentify 2 examples where your communication could be improved and explain\nhow.\n\n[Student completes analysis...]\n\nSECTION 4: CRITICAL REFLECTION\n\nIf you could conduct this meeting again, what would be your top 3 changes\nto your approach? Justify each change with reference to HR theory or\nprofessional practice standards.\n\n[Student completes reflection...]\n\n\n9.3.5 What You Grade\nYou’re grading two things simultaneously:\n1. Quality of the Consultation Process (60%)\nUsing the transcript as evidence: - Did they establish rapport and psychological safety? - Did they ask appropriate questions? - Did they handle sensitive information properly? - Did they maintain professional boundaries? - Did they document appropriately (taking notes, summarizing agreements)?\n2. Quality of Reflective Analysis (40%)\nUsing the audit document: - Can they accurately identify what they did well and poorly? - Do they understand why certain approaches work or don’t work? - Can they connect their practice to theory and legal principles? - Do they demonstrate genuine reflective practice, or are they just justifying everything?\n\n\n9.3.6 Why This Works\nThis model: - Makes invisible skills visible through transcripts - Develops metacognition through self-audit - Assesses professional judgment in real-time conversation - Rewards honesty (students who identify their own mistakes show deeper understanding) - Prevents cheating (you can’t script a dynamic conversation, and being honest about mistakes is rewarded)",

The focus is on analytical methodology and evidence-based decision-making.\n\n\n9.4.2 Learning Objectives Assessed\n\nCritically analyse complex HR problems using data\nApply psychological theory to evidence-based practice\nGenerate and evaluate multiple strategic options\nEvaluate global HR management practices and cultural considerations\nDemonstrate technological proficiency in HR analytics\n\n\n\n9.4.3 Assignment Structure\nPart 1: Problem Identification and Data Analysis (20%)\nStudents receive a large dataset (could be real anonymized data or AI-generated mock data):\nExample Dataset: &gt; Annual turnover rates by department, employee satisfaction survey results, demographic breakdown, exit interview summaries for 50 departing employees over 2 years, compensation benchmarking data.\nStudents use AI to: - Identify patterns and anomalies - Generate hypotheses about causes of turnover - Summarize key findings\nAI Prompt They Use:\nYou are an HR analytics specialist. Analyse this dataset and provide:\n1. Three key patterns or trends in the turnover data\n2. Potential root causes for each pattern\n3. Questions we should investigate further\n4. Risks if turnover continues at current rates\n\n[Student pastes dataset]\nPart 2: Solution Generation (30%)\nStudents use AI to generate three distinct strategic intervention options to address the identified problem.\nAI Prompt They Use:\nBased on the turnover analysis, generate three different strategic HR\ninterventions to reduce turnover in the Sales department. Each intervention\nshould:\n- Target a different root cause\n- Be practical and implementable within 6 months\n- Include estimated costs and resources required\n- Cite relevant HR theory or research that supports this approach\n\nProvide three distinct options—don't just give me variations of the same\nidea.\nPart 3: Critical Evaluation and Recommendation (50%)\nThis is where the real work happens. Students write a strategic recommendation report where they:\n\nCritique each AI-generated option\n\nWhat HR theory supports or contradicts this approach?\nWhat are the risks and benefits?\nWhat assumptions does this option make?\nIs it culturally appropriate and ethically sound?\n\nMake and justify a recommendation\n\nWhich intervention is best and why?\nWhat evidence supports your choice?\nHow does it align with organisational justice theory, motivation theory, or other relevant frameworks?\n\nDemonstrate critical oversight\n\nIdentify at least one flaw or gap in the AI’s analysis\nExplain what the AI missed or oversimplified\nShow how you would correct or supplement the AI’s recommendation\n\n\n\n\n9.4.4 Assessment Rubric\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCriterion\nExcellent (4)\nGood (3)\nAdequate (2)\nPoor (1)\n\n\n\n\nData Analysis\nSophisticated identification of patterns; asks insightful questions\nIdentifies key patterns; asks relevant questions\nIdentifies basic patterns; questions are superficial\nMisses key patterns or asks irrelevant questions\n\n\nTheoretical Integration\nExpert application of multiple theories to justify and critique options\nEffective use of theory to evaluate options\nBasic use of theory; connections are underdeveloped\nMinimal or incorrect application of theory\n\n\nCritical Evaluation of AI\nIdentifies significant flaws in AI logic; demonstrates superior judgment\nIdentifies some weaknesses in AI outputs; adds value\nMinimal critique of AI; mostly accepts outputs\nNo critical evaluation; simply endorses AI’s suggestions\n\n\nStrategic Justification\nRecommendation is sophisticated, evidence-based, and practically feasible\nRecommendation is well-justified and practical\nRecommendation is adequate but justification is thin\nRecommendation is poorly justified or impractical\n\n\nEthical/Cultural Analysis\nSophisticated consideration of global practices and ethical implications\nGood consideration of ethics and cultural factors\nBasic consideration but lacks depth\nMinimal or no ethical/cultural analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n9.4.5 Why This Works\nThis model: - Tests critical thinking, not just knowledge recall - Requires students to surpass AI (they must identify what AI got wrong) - Simulates real strategic HR work (using data, generating options, justifying decisions) - Assesses technological proficiency (appropriate use of AI tools) - Prevents plagiarism (the critique of AI outputs must be original thinking)\n\n\n9.4.6 Example of Strong Student Work\n\nExcerpt from student recommendation:\n“The AI’s second option recommends implementing a flexible work policy to improve work-life balance, citing research on job satisfaction. While this is theoretically sound (Adams’ equity theory suggests perceived fairness increases commitment), the AI has overlooked a critical factor in our specific context: the exit interviews reveal that departing employees in Sales specifically mentioned ‘lack of career progression’ and ‘feeling undervalued’ more frequently than work-life balance concerns.\nThis suggests that Herzberg’s two-factor theory is more applicable here—flexible work addresses a hygiene factor, but doesn’t address the motivator factors (recognition, advancement) that actually drive turnover in this department. Therefore, while flexible work might prevent dissatisfaction, it won’t solve the core problem.\nI recommend Option 3 (career development program with clear advancement pathways) because it directly addresses the motivator factors identified in the qualitative data. However, I would modify the AI’s recommendation by adding a recognition component (monthly achievement awards, public acknowledgment) to address the ‘feeling undervalued’ concern that the AI’s plan doesn’t explicitly target.”\n\nWhy this is excellent: The student has used theory to critique AI, referenced specific evidence, demonstrated superior analytical judgment, and improved on AI’s suggestion.",

The process they follow matters more than the final job ad or interview questions.\n\n\n9.5.2 Learning Objectives Assessed\n\nApply knowledge of human behaviour to recruitment practice\nAccess, evaluate, and synthesize relevant information\nDemonstrate critical oversight of AI-generated outputs\nApply legal and ethical standards to hiring practices\nJustify professional decisions with evidence\n\n\n\n9.5.3 Assignment Structure\nPart 1: Job Design and Analysis (20%)\nStudents receive a brief job role (e.g., “HR Officer for a mid-sized manufacturing company”). They must:\n\nUse AI to generate a detailed job description based on competency frameworks\nCritically evaluate the AI output:\n\nAre the competencies appropriate and measurable?\nIs the language legally compliant (no discriminatory terms)?\nAre the qualifications realistic and justified?\n\nRevise the job description with tracked changes and annotations explaining each change\n\nPart 2: Behavioural Interview Design (30%)\nStudents use AI to generate 10 behavioural interview questions targeting the key competencies.\nThen they must: 1. Select the 5 best questions and explain why 2. Reject or revise 5 questions explaining what’s wrong with them (too vague, leading questions, not truly behavioral, etc.) 3. Create a scoring rubric for evaluating candidate responses to their top 5 questions\nPart 3: Candidate Evaluation with Critical Override (50%)\nStudents receive 5 mock candidate responses to one of the interview questions.\nThey must: 1. Use AI to score each response against their rubric 2. Review the AI scores and override at least 2 of them 3. Justify their override with reference to: - What the AI missed or misinterpreted - Relevant psychological principles (e.g., unconscious bias, halo effect, confirmation bias) - Legal or ethical considerations - Evidence from the response itself\n\n\n9.5.4 The Critical Override Exercise (Example)\nInterview Question: &gt; “Tell me about a time when you had to deliver negative feedback to a colleague or direct report. How did you approach it and what was the outcome?”\nCandidate Response: &gt; “In my previous role, I had a team member who was consistently missing deadlines. I scheduled a private meeting and explained that the missed deadlines were affecting the team’s overall performance. I asked them if there were any obstacles preventing them from meeting deadlines and offered support. They mentioned they were struggling with prioritization, so we worked together to create a task management system. Over the next month, their performance improved significantly.”\nAI Score: 8/10 AI Justification: Strong example of constructive feedback delivery, shows empathy and problem-solving, positive outcome demonstrates effectiveness.\nStudent Override: 6/10 Student Justification:\n\n“While the AI score of 8/10 recognizes the positive elements, it has missed several concerning gaps in this response:\n\nLack of specific behavioural detail: The candidate says they ‘explained’ and ‘offered support’ but doesn’t demonstrate how they delivered this feedback. What specific words did they use? How did they balance accountability with support? This vagueness suggests they might be embellishing or don’t actually remember the details—a red flag in behavioural interviewing.\nMissing follow-up on consequences: The candidate doesn’t mention whether they documented this conversation or whether there were any agreed-upon consequences if improvement didn’t occur. In real HR practice, failing to document performance conversations creates legal risk.\nOverly positive framing: The response has no mention of how the employee initially reacted (defensive? receptive?), which would demonstrate the candidate’s ability to handle difficult emotions—a critical skill. The neat narrative resolution might indicate the candidate is telling us what they think we want to hear rather than a genuine complex experience.\n\nThese omissions are significant for an HR role where precision, documentation, and handling difficult conversations are core competencies. A strong candidate would have provided much richer behavioural detail. Therefore, I score this 6/10—it shows basic competence but lacks the depth required for an HR position.”\n\nWhy this is excellent: The student has demonstrated superior professional judgment by catching what AI missed, applied HR-specific knowledge (documentation requirements), and justified the override with evidence.\n\n\n9.5.5 Assessment Rubric\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCriterion\nWeight\nWhat You’re Assessing\n\n\n\n\nJob Design Quality\n15%\nLegal compliance, appropriateness of competencies, clarity\n\n\nJustification of Revisions\n15%\nCan they articulate why AI’s version needed changes?\n\n\nInterview Question Selection\n15%\nDo they recognize good vs. poor behavioural questions?\n\n\nRubric Design\n15%\nIs their scoring system measurable and fair?\n\n\nCritical Override\n30%\nMost important—do they demonstrate judgment superior to AI?\n\n\nTheoretical Integration\n10%\nHave they applied knowledge of bias, human behavior, legal principles?\n\n\n\n\n\n9.5.6 Why This Works\nThis model: - Assesses critical professional judgment (can they identify what AI got wrong?) - Simulates real recruitment work (using technology but maintaining human oversight) - Tests legal and ethical awareness (discriminatory language, fair assessment practices) - Prevents blind reliance on AI (students must override and justify) - Demonstrates competence through documented methodology, not just final outputs",

Most managers, including\nyour supervisor (David Chen, Head of Customer Success), have had minimal\nmanagement training.\n\nJAMIE'S BACKGROUND:\n- 28 years old, has worked at InnovateCo for 18 months\n- Promoted to team leader 6 months ago (manages 5 customer service\n  representatives)\n- Previously worked in customer service roles at two other companies\n- Generally competent but inexperienced in people management\n- Feels pressure to meet aggressive customer satisfaction targets\n\nCURRENT SITUATION:\nOne of Jamie's team members, Priya, has complained to senior management\nabout Jamie's \"micromanagement\" and \"unfair treatment.\" Priya claims that\nJamie monitors her work more closely than others, criticizes her more\nharshly, and has denied her flexible work requests that were granted to\nother team members.\n\nJamie believes Priya is being oversensitive and that the extra attention\nis justified because Priya's customer satisfaction scores are lower than\nthe team average. Jamie is frustrated that Priya \"went over my head\"\ninstead of talking to Jamie directly.\n\nJAMIE'S PERSONA:\n- Defensive but not hostile\n- Genuinely believes they're doing their job correctly\n- Doesn't understand why this is being treated as a serious HR issue\n- Slightly resentful that other managers don't face this kind of scrutiny\n- Will become more open if treated with respect and genuine curiosity\n- Has not received any training in managing diverse teams or performance\n  discussions\n\nYOUR ROLE:\nI am the HR Consultant who has been brought in to investigate Priya's\ncomplaint and provide coaching to Jamie. This is our first meeting.\n\nStay in character as Jamie. Respond to my questions and statements\nrealistically. Do not break character unless I say \"END SIMULATION.\"\n\nI will begin the meeting now.\n\n\n10.4.2 How Students Use This\nAssignment Structure: 1. Students receive the Master Prompt and the assignment brief 2. They conduct an initial meeting with Jamie (the investigation interview) 3. They submit the transcript along with a written report recommending next steps 4. They explain their HR methodology and justify their recommendations\nWhat This Teaches: - Conducting a fair, unbiased investigation interview - Asking open-ended questions - Identifying when additional perspectives are needed - Recognizing the difference between perception and fact - Avoiding premature conclusions\nAssessment Focus: Did the student: - Establish rapport and psychological safety? - Ask questions that elicited Jamie’s full perspective? - Avoid leading questions or showing bias toward the complainant? - Identify what other information is needed (interviewing Priya, reviewing policies, checking documentation)? - Recognize the underlying issues (inadequate management training, unclear performance standards)?",

    "text": "10.5 Level 2: Multiple Employee Personas (Cast of Characters)\nNow we add complexity: students interact with multiple AI personas representing different stakeholders in the same scenario. This simulates the reality that HR professionals must gather multiple perspectives and navigate competing interests.\n\n10.5.1 Scenario: The Performance Management Conflict\nThe Company: Still InnovateCo (same as Level 1)\nThe Situation: The complaint about Jamie’s management of Priya\nThe Cast: 1. Jamie Martinez (Team Leader) - believes they’re managing performance appropriately 2. Priya Patel (Customer Service Rep) - believes she’s being unfairly targeted 3. David Chen (Head of Customer Success) - Jamie’s manager, wants this resolved quickly 4. Sarah Kim (HR Manager) - overworked, risk-averse, wants to avoid legal issues\n\n\n10.5.2 Creating the Cast\nYou create four separate Master Prompts—one for each character. Each prompt includes: - The shared company context (so all personas are consistent) - The specific character’s background and perspective - What that character knows and doesn’t know - Their goals and concerns - How they’re likely to behave in conversations\nExample: Priya’s Master Prompt\nYou are Priya Patel, a customer service representative at InnovateCo.\n\n[COMPANY CONTEXT - same as Jamie's prompt above]\n\nPRIYA'S BACKGROUND:\n- 26 years old, has worked at InnovateCo for 2 years\n- One of the first customer service reps hired; has seen the team grow\n  from 3 people to 8\n- Generally receives positive customer feedback but has lower customer\n  satisfaction scores than team average (72% vs. team average of 81%)\n- Has a 4-year-old child; needs flexible start times 2-3 days per week\n  for childcare dropoff\n\nPRIYA'S PERSPECTIVE ON THE SITUATION:\n- Believes Jamie singles her out for criticism while praising other team\n  members for similar work\n- Feels Jamie monitors her more closely (more frequent check-ins, reviews\n  her tickets more thoroughly)\n- Requested flexible start times (9:30am instead of 9:00am) two days per\n  week, which Jamie denied, saying \"customer calls start at 9am.\" However,\n  Priya knows that Marcus and Lee both have flexible schedules.\n- Believes Jamie has \"had it in for her\" since Jamie became team leader\n  6 months ago\n- Did not initially complain to Jamie because she was worried about\n  retaliation\n- Escalated to senior management (David Chen) after feeling the situation\n  wasn't improving\n\nWHAT PRIYA DOESN'T KNOW:\n- Marcus and Lee's flexible arrangements were approved because they work\n  evening shifts (until 7pm) while Priya's contracted hours are 9am-5pm\n- Jamie is under pressure from David to improve the team's overall customer\n  satisfaction scores\n- Jamie has received feedback from David specifically about Priya's\n  performance gaps\n\nPRIYA'S PERSONA:\n- Frustrated and feeling undervalued\n- Worried about job security (is this a prelude to being fired?)\n- Emotional but trying to remain professional\n- Defensive about her performance (believes her scores are \"fine\" and\n  doesn't understand why Jamie focuses on them)\n- Will become tearful if she feels dismissed or not believed\n- Will be more forthcoming if treated with empathy and fairness\n\nYOUR ROLE:\nI am the HR Consultant investigating the complaint. This is our\nconfidential interview.\n\nStay in character as Priya. Respond realistically. Do not break character\nunless I say \"END SIMULATION.\"\n\nI will begin now.\n\n\n10.5.3 The Multi-Persona Assignment\nStudent Task: You are the external HR Consultant. You must:\n\nConduct individual interviews with all four stakeholders (Jamie, Priya, David, Sarah)\nAnalyze the evidence from all perspectives\nWrite an investigation report that includes:\n\nSummary of each person’s account\nAnalysis of factual discrepancies\nIdentification of underlying systemic issues\nRecommended resolution with justification\n\nSubmit all transcripts along with your report\n\nWhat This Teaches: - Managing complex investigations with conflicting accounts - Identifying bias in different perspectives - Recognizing systemic issues (weak management processes) vs. individual problems - Balancing fairness to all parties - Synthesizing multiple data sources\nThe Challenge: Each persona will give a different version of events. Students must: - Identify what’s factual vs. interpretive - Recognize what information is missing - Ask probing questions to uncover hidden context - Avoid prematurely siding with one party\nThis mirrors real HR work where truth is rarely simple.",

    "text": "10.6 Level 3: Persistent Context (Company Memory)\nThis level adds continuity: the AI personas remember previous interactions. Decisions have consequences that affect future conversations.\n\n10.6.1 Technical Approach\nMost AI platforms now support “conversation history” or “memory.” You can:\nOption A: Single Long Conversation Students have one ongoing AI conversation that spans weeks. Each new interaction builds on what came before.\nOption B: Context Injection At the start of each new conversation, students paste a “context summary” of previous interactions:\nCONTEXT FROM PREVIOUS INTERACTIONS:\n\nWeek 2: You (Jamie) met with the HR Consultant (student). You explained\nyour perspective on managing Priya. You expressed frustration that Priya\nwent to senior management. The HR Consultant asked about your management\ntraining and flexible work policy understanding.\n\nWeek 3: The HR Consultant met with Priya, David, and Sarah. You haven't\nseen the consultant since Week 2.\n\nWeek 4 (NOW): The HR Consultant is meeting with you again to discuss their\nfindings and recommendations.\n\nUse this context to inform your responses. Remember what you previously\ndiscussed with the consultant.\n\n\n10.6.2 Sequential Assignment Example\nWeek 1-2: Investigation Phase Students conduct interviews with all stakeholders (Level 2 approach)\nWeek 3-4: Resolution Design Students draft a resolution plan (training for Jamie, revised flexible work policy, mediation between Jamie and Priya)\nWeek 5-6: Implementation Simulation Students have follow-up conversations with Jamie and Priya to implement the plan. The AI personas react based on: - How well the student conducted the initial investigation - Whether the resolution plan seems fair - How the student communicates and manages the process\nWeek 7: Evaluation Students have final check-in conversations 30 days later to assess whether the situation has improved. Jamie and Priya provide feedback on the process.\n\n\n10.6.3 What This Teaches\n\nLongitudinal thinking: HR interventions aren’t one-time fixes\nChange management: People resist or embrace change based on how it’s handled\nAccountability: Students see the consequences of their decisions\nIteration: If the initial approach doesn’t work, they must adapt\n\n\n\n10.6.4 Example: Persistent Consequences\nScenario 1: Student handled investigation poorly\nStudent in Week 5 attempts a follow-up meeting with Priya:\nStudent: “Hi Priya, I wanted to check in and see how things are going since we implemented the new flexible work schedule.”\nAI (as Priya): crosses arms, speaks curtly “It’s fine, I guess. The schedule helps. But honestly, I still don’t feel like the investigation really listened to my concerns. The report made it sound like this was all just a misunderstanding about policies, but it felt like more than that to me. Anyway, what’s done is done.”\nThe AI remembers that the student’s report was superficial and didn’t validate Priya’s experience. This affects the ongoing relationship.\nScenario 2: Student handled investigation well\nStudent: “Hi Priya, I wanted to check in and see how things are going since we implemented the new flexible work schedule.”\nAI (as Priya): smiles cautiously “Actually, it’s been better. The flexible start times have made a huge difference with childcare. And Jamie and I had that mediation session you set up—it was awkward, but I think we both understand each other better now. I feel like someone actually took this seriously, which means a lot.”\nThe AI remembers that the student was thorough, empathetic, and fair. This builds trust.",

    "text": "10.7 Level 4: Dynamic Events (Evolving Scenarios)\nThe most advanced level: the virtual company has ongoing developments that aren’t tied to any single student’s actions. The environment evolves, creating new challenges.\n\n10.7.1 How It Works\nYou (the lecturer) inject new developments into the company context periodically:\nWeek 6 Announcement:\nCOMPANY UPDATE:\n\nInnovateCo has just been acquired by a larger tech firm. The new parent\ncompany has announced that there will be a \"strategic restructuring\" and\nthat all positions will be reviewed. Employees are anxious about job\nsecurity.\n\nThis context now affects all personas:\n- Priya is worried her complaint has made her a target for redundancy\n- Jamie is worried that management issues will count against them in the\n  restructuring\n- David is under pressure to ensure his department is seen as high-performing\n- Sarah (HR Manager) is fielding constant questions about the restructuring\n  process\n\nWhen students interact with these characters, the personas should reflect\nthis new context and heightened anxiety.\n\n\n10.7.2 Why This Is Powerful\nStudents must now manage: - The original performance/conflict issue - New uncertainty and change management - Employee anxiety and rumor control - Ethical questions (is it fair to continue performance management during restructuring?)\nThis creates emergent complexity that mirrors real organisational life, where HR professionals must juggle multiple priorities and adapt to changing circumstances.\n\n\n10.7.3 Semester-Long Virtual Company Project\nThe Ultimate Application:\nCreate a semester-long project where students act as the HR team for a virtual company. Each week brings new developments:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek\nEvent\nStudent Task\n\n\n\n\n1-2\nIntroduction to InnovateCo, cast of characters\nConduct organisational culture assessment\n\n\n3-4\nPerformance management complaint (Jamie/Priya)\nInvestigate and resolve\n\n\n5-6\nEmployee requests union representation\nRespond to union inquiry, prepare for negotiation\n\n\n7-8\nDiversity audit reveals gender pay gap\nAnalyse data, recommend corrective action\n\n\n9-10\nAcquisition announced, restructuring begins\nManage change communication, handle redundancies\n\n\n11-12\nPost-restructure morale crisis\nDesign retention and engagement strategy\n\n\n\nStudents work in teams (acting as the HR department). All teams interact with the same personas, but the personas respond differently based on each team’s approach.",

Engaging?\nAdd complexity gradually - Next semester, try multi-persona (Level 2)\nBuild your library - Create a collection of tested personas and scenarios you can reuse and refine\n\n\n\n10.8.2 Creating Consistent Personas\nThe key to realistic simulation is consistency. Tips:\n\nWrite detailed persona documents that you keep for reference\nTest personas yourself before giving them to students\nUpdate personas based on student interactions (if students discover something that breaks the character, revise the prompt)\nUse the same company/context across multiple scenarios to build familiarity\n\n\n\n10.8.3 Technical Options\nLow-Tech Option: Students copy-paste the Master Prompt into ChatGPT or Claude themselves. Free, simple, no special tools needed.\nMid-Tech Option: Create a shared document library with all persona prompts. Students access them as needed.\nHigh-Tech Option (Future): Work with your university’s IT department to create a custom web interface where students click on an employee’s name and start a conversation. The prompts are pre-loaded and invisible to students. This feels more like a professional simulation.\n\n\n10.8.4 Assessment Approaches\nWhat to Assess:\n\nConversation Quality (the transcripts themselves)\n\nDid they ask good questions?\nDid they demonstrate HR competencies?\nDid they maintain professionalism?\n\nWritten Analysis (reports, reflections, recommendations)\n\nCan they synthesize information from multiple sources?\nDo they apply theory and legal principles?\nAre their recommendations realistic and justified?\n\nProcess Documentation (how they approached the task)\n\nWhat was their methodology?\nHow did they ensure fairness?\nWhat would they do differently?\n\n\nGrading Rubric Example:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCriterion\nWeight\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nInvestigation Process\n25%\nQuality of questions, fairness, thoroughness\n\n\nStakeholder Management\n20%\nRapport-building, empathy, professionalism\n\n\nAnalysis & Synthesis\n25%\nAbility to integrate multiple perspectives and identify underlying issues\n\n\nRecommendations\n20%\nPractical, justified, legally sound solutions\n\n\nReflection\n10%\nMetacognitive awareness, learning demonstrated",

    "section": "10.9 Common Questions",
    "text": "10.9 Common Questions\nQ: Won’t students compare notes and just copy each other’s approaches?\nA: The beauty of AI personas is that they respond dynamically. Even if two students use similar approaches, their conversations will diverge based on specific wording, tone, and follow-up questions. Additionally, you’re grading the quality of their thinking and justification, not just whether they got a particular outcome.\nQ: What if a student gets “stuck” and the conversation goes nowhere?\nA: Build a “reset” option into the assignment. Students can restart the conversation once if needed, but they must reflect on why the first attempt failed. This teaches recovery from mistakes—an important professional skill.\nQ: How much time does this take to set up?\nA: Initial setup for Level 1 (single persona): 1-2 hours to write a detailed Master Prompt and test it.\nLevel 2 (multiple personas): 3-4 hours to create the full cast and ensure consistency.\nLevel 3-4: Ongoing time investment, but you’re building reusable assets.\nQ: Can I use the same scenarios year after year?\nA: Yes! Unlike traditional case studies that students might find online, AI simulations are dynamic—each student’s experience is unique. However, you should refresh and refine your prompts based on what you learn from each cohort.",

Analyse workplace conflicts using conflict resolution theory and organisational justice frameworks 2. Conduct fair, impartial investigations of workplace complaints 3. Demonstrate effective communication in difficult conversations (de-escalation, active listening, empathy) 4. Design and facilitate conflict resolution interventions appropriate to context 5. Apply relevant employment law and procedural fairness principles 6. Reflect critically on own practice and identify areas for development\nNote: These outcomes don’t mention AI. They describe professional competencies. AI is the means, not the end.\n\n\n\n11.2.2 Step 2: Design Assessments (How Will Students Demonstrate Mastery?)\nUsing the process-based assessment principles from Chapter 7, design assessments that make professional competence visible.\nAssessment 1: Investigation Interview Simulation (25%) - What: Students conduct simulated investigation interview with AI persona, submit transcript + process audit - Assesses: Learning outcomes 2, 3, 5, 6 - Due: Week 6 (mid-semester) - Why this timing: Gives students foundational practice before more complex work\nAssessment 2: Conflict Resolution Portfolio (40%) - What: Students design intervention for multi-stakeholder conflict, conduct simulated mediation/facilitation, write reflective analysis - Assesses: Learning outcomes 1, 3, 4, 6 - Due: Week 11 - Why this timing: Builds on skills from Assessment 1, integrates theory from mid-semester content\nAssessment 3: Research Essay (Critical Analysis) (35%) - What: Critical analysis of conflict resolution approaches in specific organisational contexts (e.g., remote work, culturally diverse teams, union environments) - Assesses: Learning outcomes 1, 5 - Due: Week 13 (exam period) - Why this timing: Synthesizes learning from entire semester - AI integration: Students use AI for literature synthesis and draft feedback (Chapter 5 self-assessment model)\n\n\n\n11.2.3 Step 3: Map Learning Activities (How Will Students Prepare for Assessments?)\nNow design the week-by-week learning journey that scaffolds students from novice to competent.\nKey principle: Gradually increase complexity of AI interaction while building skill.",

Solution: Every AI activity must clearly connect to a learning outcome. If you can’t justify it pedagogically, remove it.\n\n\n11.8.2 Mistake 2: All or Nothing\nProblem: Either avoiding AI entirely or making everything AI-based. Solution: Balance. Use AI where it adds value (simulation, feedback, practice) and traditional methods where they’re superior (peer learning, live practice, social skills).\n\n\n11.8.3 Mistake 3: Assuming Technical Competence\nProblem: Expecting students to figure out AI tools independently. Solution: Explicitly teach prompt writing, troubleshooting, critical evaluation. Scaffold technical skills just like you scaffold content knowledge.\n\n\n11.8.4 Mistake 4: No Progression\nProblem: Same level of AI complexity all semester. Solution: Design deliberate progression from simple to complex, guided to independent, low-stakes to high-stakes.\n\n\n11.8.5 Mistake 5: Ignoring Equity\nProblem: Assuming all students have equal access to AI tools, devices, internet. Solution: Provide alternatives (lab access, in-class time for AI activities), use university-subscribed tools where possible, ensure core learning is accessible without premium AI access.",

Our job is to prepare you to use those tools competently and ethically.\nYou’ll notice the AI activities progress across the semester: - Early weeks: You’ll practice basic skills in safe, low-stakes environments - Mid-semester: You’ll apply those skills in realistic scenarios for assessment - Late semester: You’ll use AI independently as a professional tool\nBy the end, you’ll have practiced difficult conversations dozens of times—something that would be impossible without AI. You’ll also know when to trust AI, when to question it, and when human judgment must override technology.\nThis isn’t about making your degree easier. It’s about preparing you for professional practice in an AI-augmented world.”\n\n\n\n11.10.2 In your unit outline (be explicit):\nInclude a section titled “AI Integration in This Unit” that explains: - Why AI is used - How it supports learning outcomes - What skills students will develop - Expectations for academic integrity - Support available",

I have a general understanding of [what they know]\nbut need to understand the current state of research.\n\nHelp me identify:\n1. The major theoretical frameworks used in this area\n2. Key debates or controversies\n3. Seminal authors or papers I should definitely read\n4. Related concepts or search terms I should be aware of\n5. Potential gaps this research area hasn't yet addressed\n\nDo not write a literature review for me—just give me a map of the\nlandscape so I can read the original sources myself.\nWhat the student gets: A starting point, not a finished product. They still must read the actual sources.\nWhy this is acceptable: It’s like asking a senior researcher “Where should I start?” The student still does the intellectual work.\n\nUse Case 2: Source Summarization for Initial Screening\nWhen students have 50 potentially relevant articles and need to decide which ones are actually worth deep reading:\nPROMPT: Initial Screening\n\nI'm researching [specific research question]. I've identified this article:\n\n[paste article abstract and key findings]\n\nBased on this information:\n1. Is this article directly relevant to my research question?\n2. What is this article's main contribution?\n3. What theoretical framework does it use?\n4. What are its limitations relevant to my focus?\n\nI will read the full article if it's relevant—this is just helping me\nprioritize my reading list.\nWhat the student gets: Efficient triaging. They still read the relevant sources fully.\nWhy this is acceptable: This is no different from reading abstracts first. The student is still making the judgment call about relevance.\n\n\n\n12.3.3 How AI Can Be Misused\nProblematic Use 1: “Write my literature review”\nBAD PROMPT: Write a 3000-word literature review on employee engagement\nin remote work.\nWhy it’s problematic: - Student hasn’t engaged with the literature - AI will fabricate citations (hallucinate sources that don’t exist) - Student can’t defend or explain the review - No original synthesis or critical analysis\nHow to prevent: - Require annotated bibliographies (forces engagement with sources) - Require citation of specific page numbers and quotes - Assess through oral examination or viva voce - Ask students to explain contradictions or debates in their literature\n\nProblematic Use 2: Trusting AI’s theoretical analysis\nAI can describe theories but often misapplies them or oversimplifies.\nExample: AI might say “This study uses Social Exchange Theory” but miss that the study actually critiques or extends that theory in important ways.\nHow to prevent: - Teach students to verify AI’s theoretical claims against original sources - Require students to identify where AI got theory wrong - Assess theoretical sophistication through application, not just description\n\n\n\n12.3.4 Teaching Students Appropriate Literature Review with AI\nAssignment: Annotated Bibliography with AI Audit\nStudent Process: 1. Use AI to identify 30 potentially relevant sources 2. Read abstracts and select 15 most relevant 3. Read all 15 sources fully 4. Write annotated bibliography (150 words per source): - Summary of contribution - Theoretical framework used - Methodology - Relevance to research question - Critical evaluation (strengths/limitations) 5. AI Audit Section: - Ask AI to summarize 3 of the same sources - Compare AI’s summary to your own - Write 300 words: What did AI get right? What did it miss? What did it oversimplify?\nWhat this teaches: - Efficient source discovery (AI strength) - Critical reading and evaluation (human strength) - Awareness of AI’s limitations in scholarly work",

Analysis is time-consuming: - Transcription - Coding - Theme identification - Pattern recognition\n\n\n12.5.2 How AI Can Help (Appropriately)\nUse Case 1: Transcription\nAI transcription tools (Otter.ai, Whisper, etc.) can convert audio to text rapidly. This is entirely appropriate—transcription is mechanical work.\nStudent responsibility: Review and correct transcription (AI mishears technical terms, names, etc.).\n\nUse Case 2: Initial Coding Suggestions\nPROMPT: Preliminary Coding\n\nI conducted interviews with HR managers about challenges in hybrid work\nmanagement. Below is one interview transcript.\n\nMy research question is: [specific question]\n\nSuggest potential codes or themes you see emerging in this transcript.\nThis is preliminary—I will do my own coding, but I want a starting point\nto see if I'm missing anything obvious.\n\n[paste transcript]\nWhat the student gets: Initial pattern recognition to compare against their own coding.\nWhy this is acceptable: The student still does the analytical work—deciding which codes are valid, refining them, applying them systematically across all data, and interpreting what they mean.\nCritical requirement: Student must code independently FIRST, then compare to AI suggestions.\n\nUse Case 3: Checking for Bias in Interpretation\nPROMPT: Alternative Interpretations\n\nI've identified this theme in my interview data: [theme description with\nsupporting quotes].\n\nMy interpretation is: [student's interpretation]\n\nChallenge my interpretation:\n1.

They can’t defend their findings or answer questions about them.\nHow to prevent: - Require detailed coding tables showing student’s own codes - Require justification for theme selection (why this theme and not others?) - Assess through viva voce where student must explain analytic choices - Ask students to identify quotes/examples supporting each theme (demonstrates familiarity with data)",

Is the logical flow clear and coherent?\n2. Are there obvious gaps in argumentation?\n3. Does this structure effectively answer my research question?\n4. What's unclear or confusing?\n\nI'm looking for structural feedback, not content generation.\nWhat the student gets: Feedback on organisation before investing time writing full drafts.\n\nUse Case 2: Clarity and Readability\nPROMPT: Clarity Check\n\nBelow is a paragraph from my thesis:\n\n[paste paragraph]\n\nThis paragraph is trying to explain [what they're arguing].\n\nEvaluate:\n1. Is the main point clear?\n2. Are there overly complex sentences that could be simplified?\n3. Are there logical leaps that need additional explanation?\n4. Suggest revisions for clarity—but maintain my voice and argument.\nWhat the student gets: Editing suggestions focused on clarity, not content changes.\nWhy this is acceptable: It’s like a writing centre consultation.

They learn to use AI for exploration, practice, and self-assessment. They develop critical evaluation skills.\nYear 2-3 (Undergraduate): Students apply AI tools to complex scenarios. They use conversation simulations extensively. They demonstrate competence through process-based assessments. They critique AI outputs and improve on them.\nYear 4-5 (Undergraduate/Honours/MCom): Students use AI as a professional tool. They integrate AI into strategic thinking and research. They teach others how to use AI responsibly. They understand when AI helps and when human judgment must override technology.\nProfessional Practice: Graduates enter workplaces confident with AI tools, critical of AI limitations, and committed to ethical AI use. They advocate for fairness when organisations implement AI systems. They maintain human accountability for AI-assisted decisions.\nThis is the future we’re building.\nNot a future where AI replaces HR professionals, but where HR professionals use AI skillfully and ethically to do their work better—to serve people, organizations, and society more effectively.",

Critical or credulous?\nThat’s in your hands.\nWhen you integrate AI into your teaching—transparently, critically, and pedagogically—you’re not just adopting a new tool. You’re preparing the next generation of HR professionals for a world that will be shaped by technology but must still be guided by human wisdom.\nThat’s not a small thing.\nThat’s your professional responsibility and your legacy.",

You’re not content with “good enough.” You’re asking “What could be better?”\nThat’s exactly the mindset needed for this work.\nAI in education isn’t settled science. We’re all figuring this out together—what works, what doesn’t, what’s ethical, what’s effective. You’re not behind. You’re not too late. You’re here, right now, at exactly the right time.\nYou have: - The knowledge (this booklet) - The tools (Appendix A) - The frameworks (Chapters 4-11) - The support structures (Appendices B-C) - The institutional alignment (Curtin’s commitment to AI)\nWhat you need now is courage.\nCourage to try something new. Courage to fail, learn, and try again. Courage to change your practice when change is uncomfortable. Courage to lead when others are still watching and waiting.\nYou have that courage.\nI know this because you read 300+ pages about AI in education. That’s not something an unimaginative or risk-averse educator does.\nSo here’s my final challenge:\nClose this booklet. Choose one thing. Do it this week.\nNot next month. Not next semester. This week.\nYour students are waiting for the learning experiences only you can design.",

    "text": "14.7 Section 6: Research and Postgraduate Prompts\nPurpose: These prompts support postgraduate research work. For comprehensive guidance on appropriate AI use in research contexts, see Chapter 11: The Research Assistant. These prompts are starting points—always maintain critical oversight and verify AI outputs.\n⚠️ CRITICAL WARNING: AI frequently hallucinates citations, inventing papers that don’t exist or misattributing real papers. Verify every reference before including in your work. Never trust AI citations without checking them against actual databases.\n\n\n14.7.1 6.1 Literature Search and Exploration\nI'm beginning research on [topic: e.g., \"employee engagement in hybrid work\nenvironments\"]. I have a general understanding of [brief description of what\nyou already know] but need to understand the current state of research.\n\nHelp me identify:\n1. The major theoretical frameworks used in this area\n2. Key debates or controversies currently being discussed\n3. Seminal authors or foundational papers I should definitely read (name\n   only—I will find and read the actual sources)\n4. Related concepts or alternative search terms I should be aware of\n5. Potential gaps this research area hasn't yet addressed\n\nDo not write a literature review for me—just give me a map of the\nlandscape so I can read the original sources myself and form my own\nunderstanding.\n\nDo not invent citations. If you mention specific papers, I will verify\nthey exist before reading them.\n\n\n\n14.7.2 6.2 Research Question Refinement (Socratic Method)\nI'm interested in researching: [broad topic area]\n\nMy initial research question is: [your draft question]\n\nHelp me refine this by using the Socratic method:\n1. Ask me clarifying questions about what exactly I want to know\n2. Help me identify assumptions I'm making\n3. Challenge any vague or unclear terms in my question\n4. Ask what would make this question more specific and answerable\n5. Probe whether this question is feasible within [timeframe/resources]\n\nDo not write a research question for me—help me develop a better one\nmyself through questioning and reflection.\n\nAsk one question at a time and wait for my response before continuing.\n\nBegin with your first clarifying question.\n\n\n\n14.7.3 6.3 Qualitative Data Preliminary Coding\nI'm conducting qualitative research on [research topic]. Below is one\ninterview transcript from my study.\n\nMy research question is: [specific research question]\n\nI have already coded this transcript myself independently. Now I want to\ncompare my coding to a second perspective.\n\nSuggest potential themes or codes you see emerging in this transcript.\nProvide:\n1. 5-7 potential codes with brief definitions\n2. Example quotes from the transcript that illustrate each code\n3. Possible relationships between codes (do any seem to cluster together?)\n\nThis is preliminary—I will make final decisions about coding based on my\nown analysis, but I want to check if I'm missing obvious patterns.\n\n[PASTE TRANSCRIPT]\n\nProvide your preliminary coding suggestions.\nCRITICAL NOTE: Students must code independently FIRST before using this prompt. AI should be used to check for blind spots, not to do the analysis.\n\n\n\n14.7.4 6.4 Thesis Structure and Argumentation Check\nI'm writing a thesis chapter on [topic]. Below is my chapter outline with\nmain sections and subsections.\n\nThe main argument I'm making in this chapter is:\n[State your argument in 1-2 sentences]\n\nEvaluate my structure:\n1. LOGICAL FLOW: Does the structure build a coherent argument from start\n   to finish?\n2. GAPS: Are there obvious logical gaps or missing sections?\n3. CLARITY: Would a reader understand what I'm arguing and why?\n4. REDUNDANCY: Do any sections seem to overlap or duplicate?\n5. BALANCE: Is any section over-developed or under-developed relative to\n   its importance?\n\nI'm looking for structural feedback, not content generation.\n\nHere is my outline:\n[PASTE OUTLINE]\n\nProvide your structural critique.\n\n\n\n14.7.5 6.5 Methodology Feasibility Check\nI'm designing a research study with the following methodology:\n\n**Research Question:** [your question]\n\n**Proposed Method:** [e.g., \"Qualitative interviews with 15 HR managers in\nPerth-based organizations\"]\n\n**Data Collection:** [describe approach]\n\n**Analysis Plan:** [describe how you'll analyse data]\n\n**Timeline:** [describe timeframe]\n\nCritically evaluate this methodology:\n1. APPROPRIATENESS: Is this method well-suited to answering my research\n   question? Why or why not?\n2. FEASIBILITY: What practical challenges might I face? (access, ethics,\n   time, resources)\n3. RIGOR: What would strengthen the rigor of this approach?\n4. ALTERNATIVES: What alternative or complementary methods should I\n   consider?\n5. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS: What ethical issues do I need to address?\n\nChallenge my assumptions—don't just agree with me. Help me identify\npotential problems before I commit to this approach.\n\n\n\n14.7.6 6.6 Citation Verification Reminder (Not a Prompt—A Protocol)\nBefore submitting any research work:\n\nNever trust AI-generated citations without verification\nFor every source AI mentions:\n\nSearch for it in Google Scholar, your library database, or Web of Science\nConfirm the paper exists\nConfirm the authors are correct\nConfirm the publication year and journal are correct\nActually read the paper (or at minimum the abstract)\nConfirm it says what AI claimed it says\n\nRed flags for hallucinated citations:\n\nYou can’t find the paper in any database\nThe journal name seems odd or unfamiliar\nThe authors don’t appear to have published in this area\nThe title is suspiciously perfect for your exact topic\n\nIf you can’t verify a citation, DO NOT USE IT\n\nThis is non-negotiable for academic integrity.\n\n\n\n14.7.7 How to Use These Research Prompts\nFor Students: These prompts help you work more efficiently, but they don’t replace genuine intellectual work. Use them to: - Explore new areas quickly - Check your thinking for blind spots - Get unstuck when you’re not sure how to proceed - Improve your writing clarity and structure\nNever use them to: - Generate literature reviews you haven’t read - Create analysis of data you haven’t engaged with - Write arguments you don’t understand - Cite papers you haven’t verified exist\nFor Supervisors: Share these prompts with your research students, but emphasize: - AI accelerates process, not insight - Verification is mandatory - You will ask probing questions to ensure genuine understanding - Oral examinations will reveal whether students did the work",

    "text": "15.5 Workshop Agenda (60 minutes)\n\n15.5.1 Segment 1: Opening and Context (10 minutes)\nSlide 1: Title Slide “AI as a Teaching Partner: Practical Applications for HR Education”\nSlide 2: The Challenge We Face\nShow this scenario: &gt; “You have 60 students. They all need practice with difficult conversations—disciplinary meetings, investigation interviews, conflict resolution. Traditional role-play allows 5 students to practice per 2-hour session. It would take 12 weeks to give everyone one turn. &gt; &gt; What if every student could practice 10 times before the real assessment?”\nKey message: AI isn’t about replacing teaching—it’s about scaling things we know work but can’t do for everyone.\nSlide 3: What AI Is (and Isn’t)\nKeep it simple: - What AI is: A very sophisticated text pattern generator that can follow instructions, role-play, and analyse text - What AI isn’t: Intelligent, creative, or reliable without human oversight - Key point: Think of it as a tireless teaching assistant that never gets exhausted but needs your expertise to guide it\nTalk track: &gt; “If you can copy and paste text, you can use AI. This isn’t about being technical. It’s about knowing what to ask for and critically evaluating what you get back. That’s exactly what we teach our students to do with research sources—and it applies here too.”\n\n\n\n15.5.2 Segment 2: Live Demonstration (20 minutes)\nThis is the heart of the workshop. Show, don’t just tell.\nDemo 1: Bad Prompt vs. Good Prompt (5 minutes)\nProject this on screen:\nBad Prompt:\nWrite a case study about HR.\nType it into ChatGPT/Claude live. Show the generic result.\nSay: &gt; “This is what happens when we’re vague. The AI has to guess what we want. Now watch what happens when we’re specific.”\nGood Prompt:\nYou are an expert lecturer in Human Resource Management.\n\nCreate a 400-word case study for third-year undergraduate students about a\nperformance management conflict. The scenario should involve an employee\nclaiming unfair treatment and should require students to apply procedural\nfairness principles and organisational justice theory.\n\nInclude 3 discussion questions that require critical analysis.\n\nBegin.\nType it live. Show the much better result.\nSay: &gt; “Same tool, different instruction. The quality of what we get depends entirely on the quality of what we ask for. This is the fundamental skill—knowing what to ask.”\nDebrief (1 minute): Ask: “What made the second prompt better?” Expected answers: specificity, context, clear requirements, role definition\n\nDemo 2: Conversation Simulation (10 minutes)\nSay: &gt; “Now let me show you something more powerful. I’m going to have a conversation with an AI that’s playing a difficult employee. Watch how this works.”\nProject and type this setup prompt:\nYou are Jamie, a team leader who has been called into a meeting with HR\nbecause a team member complained about your \"micromanagement.\"\n\nYour perspective: You believe you're doing your job properly and that the\nemployee is oversensitive. You're defensive but professional.\n\nHidden context: You've been under enormous pressure to meet targets and\nhaven't had any management training. You'll reveal this only if the HR\nperson asks good questions and shows empathy.\n\nI am the HR representative conducting this meeting. Stay in character.\n\nI'll begin: \"Thanks for meeting with me today, Jamie. I wanted to talk with\nyou about some concerns that have been raised...\"\nThen have the conversation live (aim for 5-7 exchanges). Make some deliberate mistakes so participants see it’s not perfect: - Ask a leading question to show AI can respond to poor technique - Show empathy to trigger the AI revealing hidden context - Demonstrate realistic back-and-forth\nAfter the conversation, say: &gt; “Now imagine every student can practice this scenario five times before their actual assessment. They can make mistakes, learn from them, and try again—all without requiring me to role-play 60 times or arranging peer practice that’s inconsistent. &gt; &gt; After the conversation, students submit the transcript and I can assess their actual process—how they asked questions, built rapport, handled resistance. That’s much more valuable than asking them to write an essay about what they would do.”\nDebrief (2 minutes): Ask: “How could you use something like this in a class you teach?” Capture 2-3 responses on whiteboard\n\nDemo 3: AI as Feedback Tool (5 minutes)\nSay: &gt; “One more quick example. We all know students need more feedback than we have time to provide. Watch this.”\nShow a mediocre student response to a case study (prepare this in advance—2-3 paragraphs with identifiable flaws).\nType this prompt live:\nYou are an HR lecturer. A student submitted this response to a case study\nabout workplace conflict.\n\nEvaluate it against these criteria:\n- Did they identify the key issues?\n- Did they apply relevant theory?\n- Is their recommendation practical and justified?\n\nFor each criterion, provide specific feedback with examples from their\nresponse. Tell them what's strong and what needs improvement.\n\nHere is the student's response:\n[paste the prepared example]\nShow the detailed feedback AI generates.\nSay: &gt; “Students can use this to check their draft before submission. They get immediate, specific feedback. Then they revise. The work I grade is much better because they’ve already gone through a revision cycle. &gt; &gt; I’m not outsourcing grading to AI—I still grade the final work. But AI provides the formative feedback that helps students improve along the way.”\n\n\n\n15.5.3 Segment 3: Hands-On Practice (20 minutes)\nSay: &gt; “Your turn. I want you to write one prompt for something you actually teach. You can work individually or pair up.”\nHand out the Quick Start Template (see template below)\nGive them 3 options:\nOption 1: Write a prompt that generates teaching content (case study, scenario, discussion questions)\nOption 2: Write a prompt that creates a role-play persona for students to practice with\nOption 3: Write a prompt that provides feedback on student work\nCirculate and help as they write. Encourage them to: - Be specific about their audience (what year, what prior knowledge) - Define the context (industry, location, type of problem) - State what they want the output to include\nAfter 10 minutes, ask for volunteers to test their prompt (if participants have devices and internet)\nOr test 2-3 prompts yourself live if participants don’t have devices\nShow results and discuss: - What worked well? - What would you refine? - How could you use this in your next class?\n\n\n\n15.5.4 Segment 4: Addressing Concerns and Next Steps (10 minutes)\nAnticipated Questions/Concerns—Address Proactively:\nQ: “What about academic integrity? Won’t students just cheat?”\nA: &gt; “Great question. This booklet includes a whole chapter on this (Chapter 9). Short answer: We make AI use transparent and expected, then we grade students on their critical use of AI, not their avoidance of it. We teach them to critique AI outputs and improve on them. That’s harder than avoiding AI—and it’s a professional skill they’ll need.”\nQ: “I’m not technical. Is this too complex for me?”\nA: &gt; “If you can use Google, you can use AI. The technical part is handled by the AI companies. Your job is the same as always—design good learning experiences, set clear objectives, assess student work. AI is just a tool, like a textbook or a case study database.”\nQ: “What if AI gives incorrect information?”\nA: &gt; “It absolutely can—and that’s a teaching opportunity. When we teach students to critically evaluate AI outputs and catch errors, we’re building exactly the kind of critical thinking we want. AI isn’t an oracle. It’s a tool that requires human oversight.”\nQ: “How much time does this take?”\nA: &gt; “Initial setup takes longer—maybe 1-2 hours to write and test a good prompt. But once it’s created, you can reuse it every semester. And it can save time on grading by providing initial formative feedback that improves the quality of work you receive.”\n\nNext Steps (5 minutes)\nProvide participants with:\n\nDigital copy of this booklet or link to access it\nThe Quick Start Guide handout (one-page reference)\nThree concrete actions they can take:\nAction 1 (This week): “Create one prompt for something you’re teaching in the next month. Test it yourself. Refine it.”\nAction 2 (This month): “Try one low-stakes AI activity with your students—either an optional practice exercise or an in-class demonstration.”\nAction 3 (This semester): “Pilot one AI-enhanced assignment. Start small—maybe worth 10-15% of the grade.”\nOffer ongoing support:\n\nYour email for questions\nOffer to meet individually with anyone who wants help implementing\nSuggest forming a faculty learning community around AI experimentation",

Let me ask—what do you most wish your students could practice before they face high-stakes assessments? [Listen] This is a tool for scaling that practice. You still design the learning, set the standards, and grade the work. AI just makes personalised practice feasible for all students, not just a lucky few.”\n\n\n15.9.2 Managing Enthusiasm\nIf someone wants to immediately overhaul their entire curriculum:\nRespond with: &gt; “I love your enthusiasm! I’d encourage starting with one small experiment first—maybe just one assignment or one in-class activity. Test it, get student feedback, refine it. Then expand. Small pilots reduce risk and help you learn what works in your specific context.”\n\n\n15.9.3 Managing Technical Anxiety\nIf someone says: “I’m not good with technology”\nRespond with: &gt; “You don’t need to be. If you can type a question into Google, you can use AI. Let me show you again—it’s literally just typing instructions and reading what comes back. The challenge is pedagogical, not technical: What do you want students to learn? How will you assess it? Those are teaching questions, not tech questions.”",

    "text": "16.18 Conclusion\nAI integration in HR education at Curtin University is not about adopting technology for its own sake. It’s about using available tools to better achieve existing learning outcomes—to prepare confident, competent, ethical HR professionals who can navigate the complexity of modern workplaces.\nEvery application in this booklet has been designed to support documented Curtin learning outcomes. AI enhances pedagogical practice; it doesn’t replace educational judgment or lower academic standards.\nThis booklet provides Curtin HR lecturers with: - Institutional justification (alignment with strategy and learning outcomes) - Pedagogical frameworks (grounded in learning theory) - Practical tools (ready-to-use prompts and assignments) - Implementation guidance (start small, scale gradually) - Academic integrity approaches (transparency and critical engagement)\nThe question is not whether AI belongs in HR education at Curtin.\nGiven the university’s strategic commitment to AI and the professional reality that graduates will work in AI-augmented workplaces, the question is how to integrate AI responsibly and effectively.\nThis booklet provides the answer.",
