This is a set of prompt-engineering techniques. They are highly adaptable to non-technical fields like Human Resources because they focus on critical thinking, process decomposition, and exploring multiple perspectives—all key skills in HR.

### 1. Reverse Prompting (for Scoping and Policy)

This technique is perfect for helping students think through the full scope of an HR initiative or policy, forcing them to consider all the variables.

**New HR Student Prompt:**
> "I need to draft a new 'Flexible Work Arrangement' policy for a 500-employee company that has both office and remote staff. I need to make sure I cover all the key areas. Ask me a series of yes/no questions to help me clarify all the requirements, considerations, and potential pitfalls for this policy."

**Why it works for HR:** HR policy and program design are all about defining requirements. This prompt forces the student to move beyond the obvious (e.g., "how many days?") and consider eligibility, equipment, performance metrics, legal implications, and fairness.

### 2. Pros and Cons (for Decision Making)

HR professionals constantly evaluate different strategies. This prompt builds the critical-thinking muscle needed to make sound, justifiable recommendations.

**New HR Student Prompt:**
> "What are the few different models for conducting performance reviews in a hybrid workforce (e.g., 360-degree feedback, continuous feedback, management by objectives)? What are the pros and cons of each model in terms of fairness, administrative overhead, and impact on employee morale?"

**Why it works for HR:** This moves students from knowing the *definition* of a model to understanding its *application* and *consequences*—a crucial step in developing strategic HR thinking.

### 3. Stepwise Chain of Thought (for Process Management)

So much of HR is about following fair, consistent, and legally compliant processes. This technique is ideal for learning and documenting those procedures.

**New HR Student Prompt:**
> "Please walk me through the entire disciplinary action process for an employee with a pattern of absenteeism, starting from the very first informal warning. Go one step at a time, explaining the action to take, what to document, and the legal consideration at that stage. Do not move to the next step until I give the keyword 'next'."

**Why it works for HR:** This slows down complex, high-stakes processes (like a grievance, a hiring cycle, or a termination) and forces the student to engage with each individual step, including the critical documentation and legal reasoning, before moving on.

### 4. Role Play (for Skill Building)

This is perhaps the most powerful technique for HR, which is full of "difficult conversations." It allows students to practice in a safe environment.

**New HR Student Prompt:**
> "You are an experienced and empathetic HR Business Partner. I am a new, nervous manager who has to put one of my employees on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP). Your goal is to coach me on how to prepare for and conduct this meeting successfully.
>
> You will lead me through the entire process, one step at a time. Start by asking me why the employee is being put on a PIP. Wait for my response before you move on to the next concept (e.g., 'Okay, now let's draft the measurable objectives for the PIP'). If I give a poor answer (e.g., 'I just don't like their attitude'), give me a hint on how to make it more objective and behavioural. Begin."

**Why it works for HR:** This provides interactive practice for core competencies like interviewing, mediation, coaching managers, and performance management, which a textbook cannot.

### 5. Debating (for Strategic and Ethical Analysis)

This technique is perfect for tackling the "gray areas" of modern HR, where ethics, business needs, and legal risks collide.

**Variation 1 (Critique):**
> "I will provide you with two different corporate 'Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)' policies. First, critique the strengths and weaknesses of each in terms of security, employee privacy, and clarity. Second, tell me which one is better and why."

**Variation 2 (Argue For/Against):**
> "I want you to debate the pros and cons of using AI-powered tools to scan resumes and filter job applicants.
> * First, make the strongest possible argument *for* using this technology (e.g., efficiency, bias reduction).
> * Second, make the strongest possible argument *against* using it (e.g., algorithmic bias, legal risk, dehumanization).
> * Finally, critique both arguments and provide a balanced summary."

**Variation 3 (Multi-Persona Debate):**
> "You will simulate a leadership debate on a 'mandatory return to office' policy. Assign roles and have them debate with each other.
> * **Role 1:** The **CFO**, who is focused on real estate costs and productivity metrics.
> * **Role 2:** The **CHRO (HR)**, who is focused on employee morale, retention, and DEI implications.
> * **Role 3:** The **COO (Operations)**, who is focused on collaboration and operational consistency.
>
> Have them debate the pros and cons from their point of view until they can recommend a consensus policy to the CEO."
