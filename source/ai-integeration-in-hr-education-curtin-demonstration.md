AI Integration in HR Education: Curtin Demonstration
Source guide
This document outlines a targeted, one-hour demonstration designed to align Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools with the pedagogical goals of Human Resource (HR) education at Curtin University. The suggestions focus on showing HR lecturers how AI can support the teaching of core concepts across undergraduate and postgraduate programmes, which include recruiting employees, fostering team performance, and understanding relevant legislative and legal rules. The demonstration is structured into three segments: showing AI's utility in recruitment and performance management (e.g., via simulated AI interviewers), demonstrating its role in strategic HR and HR analytics, and providing guidance on ethical use and promoting student technological proficiency. Ultimately, the document frames AI as a digital scaffolding crew that helps quickly build frameworks for complex topics, allowing lecturers to focus on guiding students' critical thinking and ethical application of HR principles.



This is an excellent opportunity to align the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) with the core pedagogical goals of Human Resource (HR) education at Curtin University. Since your goal is to "spark some interest" within the allocated hour, an engaging, targeted demonstration will be most effective.

The sources confirm that Human Resource Management and Industrial Relations are key areas of study, offered both at the undergraduate double degree level (Bachelor of Science (Psychology), Bachelor of Commerce (Human Resource Management and Industrial Relations)) and the postgraduate level (Human Resources Major (MCom)). Furthermore, Curtin University explicitly lists **Artificial intelligence** as a component of its values, vision, and strategy.

Here are suggestions for the one-hour meeting, structured around demonstrating AI's relevance to specific HR learning outcomes identified in the sources:

### Meeting Suggestions for HR Lecturers (1-Hour Format)

Given that the lecturers teach courses focused on Human Resources, the demonstration should highlight how AI tools can directly support the teaching of key concepts such as recruitment, workplace issue resolution, and technological proficiency.

#### 1. Focus Area: Recruitment and Performance (0–20 minutes)

One of the explicit objectives of the double degree is gaining expertise to help **recruit employees** and improve individual and **team performance**. Career paths include Human resources officer/consultant and Recruitment consultant.

| User Idea Alignment | HR Concept (from Sources) | Suggested AI Demonstration |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Interview App/Prompts** | **Recruiting employees** and preparing future **Recruitment consultants**. | **Simulated AI Interviewer:** Use a generative AI tool to create an interview environment. The lecturer can prompt the AI with a job description (e.g., for a Human resources officer) and ask it to: <br>1. Generate tailored, behavioural interview questions. <br>2. Evaluate a sample candidate response against a predefined rubric, mimicking how HR software might score initial screenings. |
| **Interactive Quiz/Flashcards** | **Building high-performing teams** and understanding **remuneration and performance**. | **Scenario Generator:** Prompt the AI to create complex performance management scenarios or case studies based on conflict in a high-performing team. Lecturers could then use this content for immediate, interactive quizzes or discussion prompts. |

#### 2. Focus Area: Strategic HR and Legal Compliance (20–40 minutes)

The postgraduate major covers **strategic HR planning**, **HR analytics**, and **employment relations**. The undergraduate degree emphasises knowledge of **relevant legislative and legal rules**.

| User Idea Alignment | HR Concept (from Sources) | Suggested AI Demonstration |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Prompts related to HR/HY** | **HR analytics** and evaluating information for evidence-based decisions. | **Data Analysis Simulation:** Demonstrate how prompts can analyse mock HR data (e.g., turnover rates, diversity metrics) and instantly summarise findings or identify potential risks, directly applying to the concept of **HR analytics**. |
| **Standalone HTML Pages** | Knowledge of **relevant legislative and legal rules**. | **Policy Drafting/Summaries:** Show how AI can quickly draft initial outlines for employee handbooks or summarise complex sections of employment law (relevant to Industrial Relations). The output can be used as a starting point for students who must critically review and refine the AI's generated policy draft, demonstrating how to "utilise critical thinking skills to evaluate and integrate information". |

#### 3. Focus Area: Pedagogical Integration and Guidance (40–60 minutes)

Since Sandra asked for "guidance" on using AI in classes, emphasize how these tools support student development. The learning outcomes explicitly state that graduates of the HR major should demonstrate **technological proficiency** and the ability for **self-directed learning**.

*   **Prompt Engineering for Learning:** Demonstrate *how* to write effective prompts that result in high-quality educational material (like better flashcards, more targeted case studies, or structured policy outlines). This addresses the need for students to "select and effectively use appropriate technologies relevant to psychological research and practice".
*   **Assessment Support:** Show how AI can be used to generate diverse assessment questions or instantly grade short-answer responses, freeing up lecturer time. Frame this as supporting the learning outcome of demonstrating **technological proficiency** in HR management contexts.
*   **Ethical Discussion:** Dedicate a few minutes to discussing academic integrity and ethical use of AI, particularly since HR professionals are expected to "apply professional skills in an ethical manner".

To solidify the idea of integrating AI into HR education, consider this analogy:

The AI tools you plan to demonstrate are not meant to replace the HR lecturers, but rather act as a **digital scaffolding crew**. They can quickly erect the framework (generating interview questions, drafting policy outlines, running initial data analysis) for complex HR topics like recruitment or strategic planning. The lecturers' crucial role is then to guide the students to inspect, refine, and secure that framework, ensuring the final structure (the student's critical output) is robust, compliant with legal rules, and ethically sound. This transition from relying solely on textbooks to actively managing AI tools is how students develop the required technological proficiency.
