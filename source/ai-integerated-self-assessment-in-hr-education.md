AI-Integrated Self-Assessment in HR Education
Source guide
This excerpt details an effective and ethical method for integrating Artificial intelligence into Human Resources education by employing AI-integrated self-assessment. The strategy involves providing students with both the grading rubric criteria and the exact AI critique prompt, promoting self-directed learning and reflective practice by allowing students to receive immediate, structured feedback on their work before formal submission. This pedagogical model is championed for fostering high-level technological proficiency and transparency, shifting the focus from plagiarism to teaching students to use AI ethically and responsibly as an advanced editing tool for analysis and improvement, thereby developing the critical thinking skills necessary for HR professionals. The text includes a suggested student-facing prompt that focuses the AI's role on impartial evaluation and constructive feedback, ensuring the student remains responsible for the necessary interpretation and improvement of their answer.



That is a highly insightful and pedagogically powerful use of Artificial Intelligence, particularly for a field like Human Resource Management, which heavily relies on applied **communication, negotiation, and empathetic practices**.

Simulating conversations, especially hard ones, with the structured approach of subsequent analysis, directly addresses several core learning outcomes for HR professionals at Curtin University.

Here are thoughts on implementing your suggestion, supported by the learning objectives found in the sources:

### 1. Simulating Hard Conversations (Voice and Text)

The concept of using AI to simulate conversational role-play is highly relevant to HR education because it allows students to practice skills in a safe environment before applying them in real-world scenarios, such as the careers of **Recruitment consultant** or **Human resources officer/consultant**.

*   **Relevance to HR Practice:** The double degree aims to provide expertise to help **resolve issues in the workplace**, **recruit employees**, and **improve individual and team performance**. The postgraduate major focuses on **optimising workplace performance and engagement** through **negotiation** and covers topics like **employment relations** and **building high-performing teams**. Simulating difficult conversations (e.g., disciplinary actions, performance reviews, redundancy) directly practices these high-stakes skills.
*   **Technological Feasibility (Voice Mode):** While the sources confirm that **Artificial intelligence** is a component of Curtin’s values, vision, and strategy, they do not specify which AI platforms (or their voice modes) are available. However, most modern AI models offer text-based conversational interfaces, and many contemporary platforms now feature robust voice capabilities. Presenting this capability, even just demonstrating the text-based interaction, aligns with the student goal to **select and effectively use appropriate technologies relevant to psychological research and practice**.
*   **Empathy and Professionalism:** Simulating these interactions allows students to practice demonstrating **empathetic practices** and applying **professional skills in an ethical manner**.

### 2. The Setup Prompt (Scenario Engineering)

This is where the low-tech, smart approach shines. The prompt must establish the AI’s persona and the scenario context to ensure the resulting conversation is high-fidelity and addresses specific learning objectives.

| HR Learning Objective (from Sources) | Purpose of Simulation | Suggested Prompt Components (High-Level) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Apply psychological theory to evidence-based practice** | Test ability to manage conflict using known theories (e.g., attribution, motivation). | *Role:* "You are a high-performing employee (Sarah) who is suddenly underperforming due to unstated personal conflict with a colleague." |
| **Knowledge of relevant legislative and legal rules** | Assess handling of sensitive or protected information and fair process. | *Constraint:* "If the student (the HR Consultant) asks you about your sick leave, refuse to provide detail, citing privacy law (IR rules)." |
| **Evaluate and apply global HR management practices, recognising cultural differences** | Practice handling diversity and cultural sensitivity in communication. | *Constraint:* "Adopt a communication style that might be common in a collectivist culture and requires the HR representative to use indirect communication." |

### 3. The Analysis Prompt (Assessment and Reflection)

The post-conversation analysis is the most valuable pedagogical step, transforming a role-play exercise into a critical assessment of skills. This supports the student's need to **utilise critical thinking skills to evaluate and integrate information** and demonstrate **ability for self-directed learning and reflective practice**.

After the simulation is transcribed, a follow-up prompt can ask the AI to **critique the student’s performance**:

*   **Ethical Evaluation:** **Prompt Example:** "Review the transcript. Did the HR representative (the student) ensure due process was followed, and did they **apply professional skills in an ethical manner**? Identify two points where they failed to demonstrate respect for human rights or cultural diversity."
*   **Communication Critique:** **Prompt Example:** "Analyse the language used by the HR representative. Did they **communicate effectively with individuals**? Did they employ **empathetic practices**? Provide specific examples of where the tone or word choice escalated or de-escalated the conflict."
*   **Theoretical Application:** **Prompt Example:** "Identify which **psychological theory** the student seemed to be applying to **resolve the issue in the workplace**. Was this application appropriate, and what evidence-based alternatives could have been used to generate innovative solutions to this problem?"

This process provides students with immediate, personalised, and objective feedback that is far more scalable than relying solely on lecturer-led role-play or human assessment. It teaches them to be highly critical of their communication and decision-making processes, which is essential for future professionals in **Industrial relations officer/consultant** roles.

***

Using AI for conversation simulation is akin to giving HR students a **flight simulator**. They can crash the metaphorical negotiation, fire the wrong person, or violate an employment law in a safe environment, and then use the subsequent analysis (the "black box recorder") to dissect their errors, learn from them, and ensure they adhere to ethical and legal standards when they move to real practice.
