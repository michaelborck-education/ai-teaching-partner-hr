Virtual HR Simulation Using Chatbot Agents
Source guide
This academic proposal details a highly innovative approach to Human Resources education at Curtin University using a virtual company staffed by conversational chatbot agents. This simulation model aims to bridge the gap between learning theoretical knowledge and practicing domain-based methodology by forcing students to apply legal, ethical, and strategic skills in real-time. The teaching method progresses from simple "Master Prompts" defining the company context and challenging employee personas to complex, persistent agents that enable scalable practice in resolving complex workplace issues. Assessment is conducted by submitting the conversation transcript, allowing lecturers to evaluate the student's problem-solving process and their ability to make evidence-based decisions on HR issues.


This "future horizon" idea is **highly innovative** and represents a natural, powerful extension of the process-based assessment methodology we have been discussing, perfectly aligning with the goals of Human Resource Management (HR) education at Curtin University.

This simulation model—creating a virtual company staffed by chatbots (or "agents")—transitions the teaching of **theory (knowledge)** into the practice of **domain-based methodology (process)** in the most realistic, yet scalable, way possible.

Here are thoughts on this future direction, grounded in the institutional and curricular context provided by the sources:

### 1. Pedagogical Alignment with Curtin’s HR Outcomes

The proposal directly addresses the most sophisticated learning outcomes required for graduates of the Bachelor of Commerce (Human Resource Management and Industrial Relations) and the Human Resources Major (MCom):

| HR Learning Outcome (from Sources) | How the Virtual Company Model Supports It |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Technological Proficiency** | Students and lecturers would actively **select and effectively use appropriate technologies** and demonstrate **technological proficiency** by interacting with, creating, or publishing the agent prompts/websites. |
| **Application of Legal/Ethical Rules** | The simulation can be designed to force students to apply **relevant legislative and legal rules** when dealing with a chatbot employee who might reference policy or an alleged breach of conduct. HR professionals must **apply professional skills in an ethical manner**. |
| **Strategic Issue Resolution** | The scenario requires students to **resolve issues in the workplace** using documented **strategic HR planning**. The chatbot employees provide endless opportunities for practicing hard conversations (like managing conflict or performance issues). |
| **Critical Thinking and Evidence-Based Decisions** | Submitting the conversation transcript allows lecturers to assess the student’s **process** in real-time. Students must **utilise critical thinking skills to evaluate and integrate information** from the virtual company’s policies and the agent's complex behaviour to make **evidence-based decisions on HR issues**. |

Curtin University explicitly lists **Artificial intelligence** as a component of its values, vision, and strategy, providing strong institutional justification for exploring this advanced application.

### 2. Implementation Strategy: From Prompt to Agent

Starting with prompts and evolving to agents/a website is the perfect way to engage "low-tech" lecturers immediately while offering a pathway for future development.

#### Phase 1: The Master Prompt (Low-Tech Entry)

The foundation is the **Master Prompt** that defines the *entire context* of the virtual company and its employee agents.

1.  **Company Definition:** A detailed prompt creates the context: "You are the HR Director of 'InnovateCo,' a mid-sized tech firm with a strict policy on **remuneration and performance**. InnovateCo's culture is highly sensitive to **cultural differences**, and your goal is to build **high-performing teams**."
2.  **Agent Persona (The Challenge):** A secondary prompt defines the specific chatbot employee: "You are 'Alex,' an engineer. You are a high performer but have recently received a written warning due to attendance issues. Your persona is defensive, and you reference Clause 4.2 of the InnovateCo 'Leave Policy' (which I will provide you) to justify your position. You hint at, but do not state, a medical condition."
3.  **Student Assessment:** The lecturer publishes this scenario and requires students to submit a conversation transcript that demonstrates their **process** in diagnosing the issue, applying policy, and communicating effectively and empathetically.

#### Phase 2: Publishing the Agent/Website (Future Horizon)

Turning the prompt into a persistent **agent** or **live website** elevates the simulation dramatically:

*   **Persistence and Complexity:** An agent that retains memory of previous student conversations or company-wide events (e.g., a recent virtual press release on restructuring) creates a more dynamic and unpredictable environment, mirroring real-world complexity in **strategic HR planning**.
*   **Scalable Assessment:** Publishing the agent means hundreds of students could interact simultaneously with the employee (or a dozen different employee agents), vastly increasing the availability of practice scenarios for complex topics like **industrial relations** or managing diversity.
*   **Collaborative Assessment:** Students could be required to collaboratively interact with multiple chatbot employees to **resolve issues in the workplace**, with the resulting conversation log submitted for analysis.

### 3. Assessment through Conversation Submission

The submission of the conversation transcript acts as the raw data for the process-based assessment.

Instead of grading *what* the student knows (theory), the lecturer grades *how* the student acted (methodology):

*   **Methodology Evaluation:** Did the student follow the **logical and rational processes to critically analyse problems**? Did they move correctly through the established HR process (e.g., investigation, interview, policy reference)?
*   **Ethical Review:** Was the student's conversation aligned with the ethical commitment to **demonstrate understanding and respect for human rights and cultural diversity** and **apply professional skills in an ethical manner**? The agent's structured analysis can highlight ethical failings in the transcript.
*   **Final Report:** The student’s final deliverable is not just the transcript, but a formal HR report justifying their methodology and decision (e.g., recommended performance plan, disciplinary action, or legislative compliance strategy), citing the relevant policies established in the virtual company and HR theory.

This methodology forces students to "pull the theory" in order to successfully interact with and resolve the complex scenario presented by the chatbot employee.
