AI Prompt Strategy for HR Education
Source guide
The text advocates for using a prompt-based approach as the most effective initial strategy for introducing Artificial Intelligence to HR lecturers, particularly those who are less familiar with technology. This method offers a low barrier to entry, allowing educators to immediately leverage AI's power to create complex HR scenarios involving relevant legislative and legal rules without needing specialized software or technical training. By focusing on learning and teaching through prompts, the strategy ensures alignment with university goals and reinforces core HR learning outcomes, such as developing technological proficiency and using critical thinking to analyse AI-generated situations. Ultimately, teaching the skill of prompt engineering is presented as a transferable, future-proof skill, maximizing pedagogical application over technical complexity.


That is a **highly effective and pragmatic strategy** for introducing AI capabilities to HR lecturers, especially those who identify as "low tech." Focusing on prompts ensures maximum impact during the one-hour session by prioritizing pedagogical utility and accessibility over technical complexity.

Here are thoughts supporting why the prompt-based approach is the correct initial plan, based on the context of the HR programs at Curtin University:

### 1. Alignment with Accessibility and Institutional Strategy

Curtin University explicitly includes **Artificial intelligence** as a component of its values, vision, and strategy. Therefore, integrating AI into teaching is supported institutionally. However, the *method* of integration must be manageable for staff.

*   **Low Barrier to Entry:** Showing lecturers how to use a few lines of well-crafted text (a prompt) to create a complex, customized HR scenario (like a difficult negotiation or a case study involving **relevant legislative and legal rules**) is immediately accessible. It requires no complex software installation, licensing, or specialized user interface training, making it "in the reach of most lecturers."
*   **Focus on Pedagogy, Not Technology:** Since the audience is "smart people" but "low tech," the demonstration needs to focus on *what* the AI can do for **learning and teaching**, not *how* to build the application itself. The prompt is the simplest interface to demonstrate the power of generative AI for tasks like conflict resolution and performance improvement.

### 2. Reinforcing Core HR Learning Outcomes

The prompt-based conversational simulation directly supports key learning outcomes by requiring high-quality input and critical analysis of the output.

*   **Developing Technological Proficiency:** Students are expected to **"select and effectively use appropriate technologies relevant to psychological research and practice"** and **"demonstrate effective communication, leadership, and technological proficiency in HR management contexts"**. Learning to write effective prompts is the fundamental skill required to leverage AI. By starting with prompts, you are establishing the groundwork for technological proficiency.
*   **Critical Thinking through Analysis:** The value of the conversational simulation lies in the post-interaction analysis (the second prompt). This supports the graduate outcome to **"utilise critical thinking skills to evaluate and integrate information from various credible sources, making evidence-based decisions on HR issues"**. Whether the simulation runs through a dedicated app or a simple chat interface, the *critical process* of analysing the transcript and critiquing the ethical and legislative implications is the same. The prompt is the simplest way to execute this critical analysis.
*   **Ethical Practice:** Using prompts to define ethical constraints (e.g., "Act as a compliant HR manager") or to analyse bias in the AI's response is a transparent way to teach students how to **"apply professional skills in an ethical manner"**. This addresses the need for professionals to **"evaluate and apply global HR management practices, recognising cultural differences and ethical considerations"**.

### 3. Future-Proofing the Conversation

While showing a dedicated app or agent might look polished, focusing on **prompt engineering** prepares the lecturers for future tools.

*   **Prompt as the Core Skill:** Prompts are the language of interaction across all generative AI interfaces—whether it’s a simple chat window, an academic agent system, or a bespoke HR app. By teaching the *skill of prompting*, you are giving them a transferable skill applicable regardless of whether the university later adopts a specialized **agent** or **app**.

**Conclusion:**

For this introductory meeting focused on sparking interest and providing guidance, the plan to demonstrate AI using **powerful, well-engineered prompts** is ideal. It minimizes technical barriers while maximizing the focus on **pedagogical application** and alignment with critical HR learning outcomes, such as **critical thinking**, **technological proficiency**, and the ethical resolution of workplace issues. It focuses the lecturers' energy on designing high-quality scenarios rather than troubleshooting software.
