# Getting Started - Your First AI Conversation

## What You'll Do in This Chapter

In the next 15 minutes, you're going to have your first productive conversation with an AI tool. By the end of this chapter, you'll understand:

- How to access free AI tools (no installation required)
- What a "prompt" actually is
- How to write clear instructions that get useful results
- The difference between a weak prompt and a powerful one
- How to think about AI as a teaching assistant, not a magic oracle

Let's jump straight in.

## Step 1: Accessing an AI Tool

You have several free options. I recommend starting with one of these two:

### Option A: ChatGPT (by OpenAI)
1. Go to **chat.openai.com** in any web browser
2. Create a free account (takes 2 minutes)
3. You'll see a simple text box at the bottom of the screen
4. That's it—you're ready to go

### Option B: Claude (by Anthropic)
1. Go to **claude.ai** in any web browser
2. Create a free account
3. Same interface—a clean text box waiting for your instructions

Both work essentially the same way. For this booklet, examples will work with either tool. Choose whichever interface you prefer.

**Note:** You don't need to download anything, install software, or configure settings. It's as simple as using Google—type something in, get a response back.

## Step 2: Understanding Prompts

A **prompt** is simply the instruction or question you type into the AI tool. Think of it like briefing a very capable research assistant who:

- Has read an enormous amount of material on nearly every subject
- Can generate text, analyse situations, and role-play scenarios
- Follows your instructions literally (which is both powerful and requires precision)
- Doesn't have opinions, emotions, or genuine understanding—just pattern recognition

The quality of what you get back depends almost entirely on the quality of your prompt.

Let's see this in action.

## Your First Prompt: The Weak Version

Open your chosen AI tool and type this exactly:

```
Write a case study about business.
```

Hit enter and see what you get.

You'll probably receive something generic—maybe a story about a marketing campaign or a financial decision. It's *fine*, but it's not particularly useful for your specific teaching needs.

**Why was this weak?** Because the prompt was vague. "Business" covers everything from accounting to marketing. "A case study" could be 100 words or 5,000 words. The AI had to guess what you wanted.

## Your Second Prompt: The Powerful Version

Now try this. Copy and paste the prompt that matches your discipline:

Hit enter.

**Notice the difference?** The AI now knows:
- What role to adopt (expert lecturer in YOUR discipline)
- Who the audience is (undergraduate students)
- What specific learning objective you're targeting (discipline-specific skill)
- What the scenario should contain (field-specific challenge)
- How long it should be (300-400 words)
- What format you want (scenario + three discussion questions)

The output should be dramatically more useful. It's tailored to your discipline, specific, and ready to use in your class (with your refinement, of course).

## The Anatomy of a Good Prompt

Let's break down what made that second prompt powerful:

### 1. **Set the Role**
> "You are an expert lecturer in Business Management..."

This tells the AI what perspective to adopt. Effective roles depend on your discipline:

::: {.panel-tabset}

## Business & Marketing
"You are an experienced marketing director launching a new product" or "You are a market research analyst evaluating competitive positioning"

## Management
"You are a senior manager navigating organisational change" or "You are an executive coach helping with team dynamics"

## Human Resources
"You are an HR business partner handling sensitive employee situations" or "You are a recruitment specialist evaluating candidate fit"

## Tourism & Hospitality
"You are a hotel general manager managing service delivery" or "You are a guest services trainer improving customer experience"

## Supply Chain & Logistics
"You are a supply chain manager handling network optimization" or "You are a logistics director managing disruption"

## Information Systems
"You are an IT project manager implementing enterprise systems" or "You are a systems analyst gathering requirements"

## Accounting & Finance
"You are an auditor evaluating financial statements" or "You are a financial analyst making investment recommendations"

## Economics
"You are an economist advising on policy decisions" or "You are a researcher analysing economic trends"

:::

The role shapes the tone, vocabulary, and approach of the response.

### 2. **Define the Context and Audience**
> "I need you to create a case study for my undergraduate students..."

Who is this for? What's the purpose? This prevents the AI from pitching the content at the wrong level (too simple for postgrads, too complex for first-years).

### 3. **Specify the Task Clearly**
> "...that will help them practice applying strategic decision-making to a business challenge."

What exactly do you want? Don't just say "write something about business strategy." Say what the student should *do* with it.

### 4. **Provide Constraints and Requirements**
> "The scenario should involve..." "Include enough detail..." "300-400 words..." "End with three discussion questions..."

These boundaries guide the AI and prevent it from going off in unhelpful directions. Think of constraints as guardrails.

### 5. **Give a Clear Start Signal**
> "Begin."

This tells the AI to execute the task now. Simple, but effective.

## Practice Exercise: Your Turn

Now it's your turn to write a prompt from scratch. Think of something you currently teach in your business course—a topic where you wish you had more practice materials or better scenarios.

Use this template:

```
You are [define the role].

I need you to [state the specific task] for [define your audience].

Here are the requirements:
- [Requirement 1]
- [Requirement 2]
- [Requirement 3]

[Any additional context or constraints]

Begin.
```

## What to Expect (and Not Expect)

As you experiment, keep these realities in mind:

### What AI Does Well:
- Generates diverse scenarios and examples quickly
- Creates consistent, well-structured text
- Role-plays different perspectives convincingly
- Provides frameworks and outlines
- Analyzes text against criteria you define

### What AI Doesn't Do:
- Understand context the way humans do
- Have actual expertise or professional judgment
- Know your specific students, university policies, or local employment laws
- Guarantee factual accuracy (it can confidently state incorrect information)
- Replace your pedagogical design or assessment judgment

**The golden rule:** AI is a powerful draft generator and practice partner. You are still the expert who evaluates, refines, and ensures accuracy.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

**"The AI gave me something too simple/complex."**
→ Add to your prompt: "Pitch this at the level of a third-year undergraduate student" or specify your context: "This is for students with no prior supply chain experience" or "Students already understand financial statement analysis."

**"The response was too short/long."**
→ Specify word count or structure: "Provide 500 words" or "Write exactly 5 paragraphs" or "Create a scenario followed by 4 discussion questions."

**"It's too generic—not specific to Australia/my context."**
→ Add context relevant to your discipline:

::: {.panel-tabset}

## Business & Marketing
"Set this in an Australian retail context" or "Reference Australian Consumer Law and ACCC regulations"

## Management
"Set this in an Australian public sector organisation" or "Reference Fair Work Act requirements"

## Human Resources
"Include Australian employment law and Fair Work Commission context" or "Reference Australian workplace discrimination law"

## Tourism & Hospitality
"Set this in an Australian hotel/tourism context" or "Reference Australian tourism industry standards"

## Supply Chain
"Set this in an Australian manufacturing context" or "Reference Australian logistics regulations"

## Information Systems
"Reference Australian Privacy Act and data protection requirements" or "Set in Australian banking context"

## Accounting & Finance
"Reference Australian Accounting Standards and ASIC rules" or "Use Australian tax law context"

## Economics
"Reference Australian economic policy and RBA context" or "Use Australian labour market data"

:::

**"The AI ignored part of my prompt."**
→ This happens sometimes. Just follow up: "Please revise that to include [the missing element]."

**"I want to change just one part."**
→ You can have a conversation: "Keep everything the same, but make the scenario more realistic" or "Add a section about the ethical considerations" or discipline-specific tweaks like "Include regulatory compliance issues" or "Add supply chain complexity."

## Your First Win

If you've followed along, you've just:
1. Accessed an AI tool
2. Written a structured prompt
3. Generated a teaching resource you didn't have 5 minutes ago

That's not a small thing. You've learned the fundamental skill that everything else in this booklet builds on.

Get comfortable with the basic rhythm: prompt → response → refine → use.

The more you practice, the more natural it becomes. And the more specific your prompts, the more useful your outputs.
