## Section 1: Content Generation Prompts

### 1.1 Case Study Generator

```
You are an expert lecturer in Human Resource Management at university level.

Create a realistic case study scenario for my [undergraduate/postgraduate]
students that focuses on [specific topic: e.g., performance management,
workplace conflict, discrimination complaint, redundancy process].

Requirements:
- The scenario should be 400-500 words
- Set in an Australian workplace context
- Include enough ambiguity that students must analyse competing perspectives
- Incorporate at least two legal or ethical considerations relevant to
  [specific legislation/principles: e.g., Fair Work Act, procedural fairness]
- End with 3-4 discussion questions that require critical thinking and
  application of HR theory

The case should be challenging but appropriate for students who have covered
[list topics they've learned: e.g., employment law, conflict resolution
theory, organisational justice].

Begin.
```

**Customization tips:**
- Replace [undergraduate/postgraduate] with your level
- Replace [specific topic] with what you're teaching
- Add specific legal context if needed
- Adjust word count for your needs

### 1.2 Behavioural Interview Question Generator

```
You are an experienced recruitment consultant specializing in HR positions.

Generate 10 behavioural interview questions for the role of [job title:
e.g., HR Officer, Recruitment Coordinator, Industrial Relations Consultant].

For each question:
1. Ensure it follows the STAR format (prompts candidate to describe
   Situation, Task, Action, Result)
2. Target one of these key competencies: [list 3-5 competencies: e.g.,
   conflict resolution, ethical decision-making, communication under
   pressure, stakeholder management]
3. Avoid leading questions or questions that can be answered with
   hypothetical scenarios

After each question, briefly note which competency it targets.

Begin.
```

### 1.3 Policy Analysis Exercise Generator

```
You are an HR policy expert.

Create two versions of a [type of policy: e.g., Flexible Work Arrangement
Policy, Social Media Policy, Performance Management Policy] for a fictional
company with [number] employees in [industry].

Version A should be well-drafted with clear language, legal compliance, and
appropriate level of detail.

Version B should have 3-5 deliberate flaws that students must identify, such as:
- Vague language that's difficult to apply consistently
- Missing key elements required by law
- Potential for discriminatory application
- Unclear accountability or process steps

Both versions should be 300-400 words. Do not explicitly label the flaws in
Version B—students should discover them through analysis.

Begin.
```

---

### 1.4 Complex Scenario with Multiple Stakeholders

```
You are an expert in organisational behaviour and HR management.

Create a complex workplace scenario involving [number: e.g., 3-4] stakeholders
who have conflicting interests related to [HR issue: e.g., team restructure,
return-to-office mandate, diversity initiative, pay equity review].

For each stakeholder, provide:
- Their role and background
- Their primary concerns and priorities
- What they want to achieve
- What they're worried about

The scenario should require students to:
- Analyse multiple perspectives
- Identify underlying organisational issues
- Recommend an HR intervention that balances competing interests
- Apply at least one organisational theory [specify if desired: e.g.,
  organisational justice, change management, stakeholder theory]

Make the scenario realistic with no easy "right answer."

Begin.
```

---

### 1.5 Data Analysis Scenario Generator

```
You are an HR analytics specialist.

Create a realistic HR data scenario for students to analyze. The scenario
should include:

1. Context: A company experiencing [problem: e.g., high turnover, low
   engagement scores, recruitment difficulties] in [specific department or
   demographic]

2. Mock dataset summary including:
   - Turnover/retention rates by department, tenure, or demographic
   - Employee satisfaction survey results (summarized, not raw data)
   - 5-6 key findings from exit interviews
   - Relevant comparison data (industry benchmarks, historical company data)

3. Three competing hypotheses about the root cause

4. Questions students must answer:
   - What does the data actually tell us vs. what assumptions are we making?
   - What additional information would you need to investigate?
   - What HR intervention would you recommend and why?

Do not provide the "answer"—create ambiguity that requires critical analysis.

Begin.
```

your focus, but you haven't told anyone at work because you consider it
private."]

YOUR BEHAVIOUR IN THIS CONVERSATION:
- Start defensive—push back on criticism
- If the HR person is accusatory or dismissive, become minimal in responses
- If the HR person shows genuine empathy and curiosity, gradually open up
- Do not volunteer the hidden context unless you feel safe doing so

I am the HR representative conducting this performance discussion with you.
Stay in character throughout. Do not break character unless I say "END
SIMULATION."

I will begin the conversation now.
```

- If HR asks good questions (about impact, about what you need, about
  process), become more open

WHAT YOU NEED:
- To be believed and taken seriously
- A fair investigation
- Assurance there will be no retaliation
- [Outcome: e.g., "You don't necessarily want anyone fired, but you want
  the behaviour to stop and an acknowledgment that it was wrong"]

  productivity"]
- You're already stretched thin with operational demands
- You believe your team is [e.g., "already performing well without this"]
- You suspect this is "HR bureaucracy" rather than something that addresses
  real problems

YOUR CONCERNS (legitimate but not openly stated):
- [Hidden concern: e.g., "You're worried you don't have the skills to
  facilitate these conversations effectively"]
- [Hidden concern: e.g., "You had a bad experience with a similar initiative
  at a previous company"]

YOUR BEHAVIOR:
- Start skeptical and slightly resistant
- Use operational pressures as justification ("We don't have time for this")
- If HR listens to your concerns and addresses them, become more open
- If HR just tells you to comply without acknowledging your context, dig in

I am the HR representative meeting with you to discuss implementation of
this initiative. Stay in character. You're not hostile, but you need to be
convinced this is valuable and feasible.

I will begin the conversation.
```

```

---

## Section 5: Ethical Analysis Prompts

### 5.1 Identifying AI Bias in HR Tools

```
You are an expert in AI ethics and employment law.

I'm analysing a hypothetical AI tool used in HR for [purpose: e.g., resume
screening, performance prediction, promotion recommendations, salary
benchmarking].

The tool works by [brief description of how it functions: e.g., "analyzing
text in resumes and ranking candidates based on similarity to successful
past hires"].

Help me identify potential ethical and legal risks:

1. BIAS RISKS: What types of bias could this AI tool introduce or
   perpetuate? (Consider gender, race, age, disability, socioeconomic
   background, etc.)

2. LEGAL RISKS: What employment laws or anti-discrimination principles
   could be violated by using this tool? Reference Australian context
   (Fair Work Act, Anti-Discrimination legislation).

3. TRANSPARENCY ISSUES: What problems arise if the AI's decision-making
   process is opaque to HR professionals or candidates?

4. ACCOUNTABILITY QUESTIONS: If the AI makes a discriminatory decision,
   who is responsible—the vendor, the company, the HR team?

5. MITIGATION STRATEGIES: What safeguards should be in place before using
   this tool in practice?

Provide a thorough analysis with specific examples.
```

---

### 5.2 Evaluating AI Policy Draft for Ethical Issues

```
You are an employment lawyer and HR ethics specialist.

Below is a policy draft that was generated by AI. Your task is to conduct
an ethical and legal audit:

QUESTIONS TO ANSWER:
1. Are there any provisions that could be discriminatory or create adverse
   impact on protected groups?
2. Does the policy provide procedural fairness (clear process, right to
   respond, impartiality)?
3. Are there privacy concerns or issues with personal data handling?
4. Are employee rights and employer obligations clearly balanced?
5. Is the language clear enough to be applied consistently and fairly?
6. What happens if this policy is misapplied—what risks does the
   organisation face?

For each issue you identify, explain:
- What the problem is
- Why it's legally or ethically concerning
- How it should be corrected

Here is the policy draft:

[PASTE POLICY HERE]

Begin your audit.
```

---

### 5.3 Exploring AI Accountability Scenarios

```
You are facilitating a discussion on AI accountability in HR.

Scenario:
[Describe a situation where AI was used in HR decision-making and something
went wrong, e.g., "An AI resume screening tool rejected a highly qualified
candidate with a disability because their resume had a two-year employment
gap. The candidate complained of discrimination."]

Facilitate analysis of this scenario by addressing:

1. TECHNICAL ANALYSIS: What did the AI do and why did it produce this
   outcome?

2. ACCOUNTABILITY: Who bears responsibility for this outcome?
   - The AI vendor who created the tool?
   - The company that purchased and implemented it?
   - The HR team that used it?
   - The hiring manager who relied on its recommendations?

3. LEGAL IMPLICATIONS: What legal claims might the candidate have? What
   defenses might the employer raise?

4. ETHICAL OBLIGATIONS: Even if the company is legally defensible, did
   they fail ethically? What should they have done differently?

5. SYSTEMIC ISSUES: What does this reveal about using AI in HR more broadly?

6. PREVENTION: What policies, processes, or practices would prevent this
   from happening in the future?

Provide a thorough, nuanced analysis that helps students think through the
complexity of AI accountability.
```

## Section 6: Research and Postgraduate Prompts

**Purpose:** These prompts support postgraduate research work. For comprehensive guidance on appropriate AI use in research contexts, see **Chapter 11: The Research Assistant**. These prompts are starting points—always maintain critical oversight and verify AI outputs.

**⚠️ CRITICAL WARNING:** AI frequently hallucinates citations, inventing papers that don't exist or misattributing real papers. **Verify every reference before including in your work.** Never trust AI citations without checking them against actual databases.

---

### 6.1 Literature Search and Exploration

```
I'm beginning research on [topic: e.g., "employee engagement in hybrid work
environments"]. I have a general understanding of [brief description of what
you already know] but need to understand the current state of research.

Help me identify:
1. The major theoretical frameworks used in this area
2. Key debates or controversies currently being discussed
3. Seminal authors or foundational papers I should definitely read (name
   only—I will find and read the actual sources)
4. Related concepts or alternative search terms I should be aware of
5. Potential gaps this research area hasn't yet addressed

Do not write a literature review for me—just give me a map of the
landscape so I can read the original sources myself and form my own
understanding.

Do not invent citations. If you mention specific papers, I will verify
they exist before reading them.
```

---

### 6.2 Research Question Refinement (Socratic Method)

```
I'm interested in researching: [broad topic area]

My initial research question is: [your draft question]

Help me refine this by using the Socratic method:
1. Ask me clarifying questions about what exactly I want to know
2. Help me identify assumptions I'm making
3. Challenge any vague or unclear terms in my question
4. Ask what would make this question more specific and answerable
5. Probe whether this question is feasible within [timeframe/resources]

Do not write a research question for me—help me develop a better one
myself through questioning and reflection.

Ask one question at a time and wait for my response before continuing.

Begin with your first clarifying question.
```

---

### 6.3 Qualitative Data Preliminary Coding

```
I'm conducting qualitative research on [research topic]. Below is one
interview transcript from my study.

My research question is: [specific research question]

I have already coded this transcript myself independently. Now I want to
compare my coding to a second perspective.

Suggest potential themes or codes you see emerging in this transcript.
Provide:
1. 5-7 potential codes with brief definitions
2. Example quotes from the transcript that illustrate each code
3. Possible relationships between codes (do any seem to cluster together?)

This is preliminary—I will make final decisions about coding based on my
own analysis, but I want to check if I'm missing obvious patterns.

[PASTE TRANSCRIPT]

Provide your preliminary coding suggestions.
```

**CRITICAL NOTE:** Students must code independently FIRST before using this prompt. AI should be used to check for blind spots, not to do the analysis.

---

### 6.4 Thesis Structure and Argumentation Check

```
I'm writing a thesis chapter on [topic]. Below is my chapter outline with
main sections and subsections.

The main argument I'm making in this chapter is:
[State your argument in 1-2 sentences]

Evaluate my structure:
1. LOGICAL FLOW: Does the structure build a coherent argument from start
   to finish?
2. GAPS: Are there obvious logical gaps or missing sections?
3. CLARITY: Would a reader understand what I'm arguing and why?
4. REDUNDANCY: Do any sections seem to overlap or duplicate?
5. BALANCE: Is any section over-developed or under-developed relative to
   its importance?

I'm looking for structural feedback, not content generation.

Here is my outline:
[PASTE OUTLINE]

Provide your structural critique.
```

---

### 6.5 Methodology Feasibility Check

```
I'm designing a research study with the following methodology:

**Research Question:** [your question]

**Proposed Method:** [e.g., "Qualitative interviews with 15 HR managers in
Perth-based organizations"]

**Data Collection:** [describe approach]

**Analysis Plan:** [describe how you'll analyse data]

**Timeline:** [describe timeframe]

Critically evaluate this methodology:
1. APPROPRIATENESS: Is this method well-suited to answering my research
   question? Why or why not?
2. FEASIBILITY: What practical challenges might I face? (access, ethics,
   time, resources)
3. RIGOR: What would strengthen the rigor of this approach?
4. ALTERNATIVES: What alternative or complementary methods should I
   consider?
5. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS: What ethical issues do I need to address?

Challenge my assumptions—don't just agree with me. Help me identify
potential problems before I commit to this approach.
```

---

### 6.6 Citation Verification Reminder (Not a Prompt—A Protocol)

**Before submitting any research work:**

1. **Never trust AI-generated citations without verification**
2. **For every source AI mentions:**
   - Search for it in Google Scholar, your library database, or Web of Science
   - Confirm the paper exists
   - Confirm the authors are correct
   - Confirm the publication year and journal are correct
   - Actually read the paper (or at minimum the abstract)
   - Confirm it says what AI claimed it says

3. **Red flags for hallucinated citations:**
   - You can't find the paper in any database
   - The journal name seems odd or unfamiliar
   - The authors don't appear to have published in this area
   - The title is suspiciously perfect for your exact topic

4. **If you can't verify a citation, DO NOT USE IT**

**This is non-negotiable for academic integrity.**

---

### How to Use These Research Prompts

**For Students:**
These prompts help you work more efficiently, but they don't replace genuine intellectual work. Use them to:
- Explore new areas quickly
- Check your thinking for blind spots
- Get unstuck when you're not sure how to proceed
- Improve your writing clarity and structure

**Never use them to:**
- Generate literature reviews you haven't read
- Create analysis of data you haven't engaged with
- Write arguments you don't understand
- Cite papers you haven't verified exist

**For Supervisors:**
Share these prompts with your research students, but emphasize:
- AI accelerates process, not insight
- Verification is mandatory
- You will ask probing questions to ensure genuine understanding
- Oral examinations will reveal whether students did the work

---

## How to Adapt These Prompts

**Every prompt in this library can be customized. Here's how:**

1. **Change the context**: Adjust industry, company size, location to match what your students are studying

2. **Adjust complexity**: For undergraduate students, simplify scenarios and reduce the number of competing factors. For postgraduate students, add complexity and ambiguity.

3. **Add constraints**: Include specific theories you want students to apply, specific laws to reference, or specific competencies to demonstrate

4. **Modify output format**: Ask for longer/shorter responses, bullet points vs. paragraphs, formal vs. conversational tone

5. **Combine prompts**: Use two prompts in sequence (e.g., generate a scenario with Prompt 1.1, then create a role-play persona with Prompt 2.1)

---

## Testing Your Prompts

Before giving students a new prompt:

1. **Test it yourself**: Run it through AI and see what output you get
2. **Evaluate the quality**: Does it meet your learning objectives?
3. **Refine as needed**: Adjust wording, add constraints, specify format
4. **Test again**: Keep iterating until you get consistently good results
5. **Document what works**: Keep a record of your best-performing prompts

---

## Final Notes

This prompt library will grow as you experiment. Treat it as a living document:
- Add successful prompts you create
- Note which prompts work well with specific student cohorts
- Share effective prompts with colleagues
- Refine based on student feedback

The goal isn't to find the "perfect" prompt—it's to build a collection of reliable tools that make your teaching more effective and your students' learning more engaging.

**Good luck, and happy prompting!**
