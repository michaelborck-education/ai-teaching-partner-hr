# Chapter 11: The Research Assistant (Postgraduate Focus)

## AI in Research: Promise and Peril

If you teach postgraduate HR students—particularly those in the Human Resources Major (MCom) or supervising research projects—you face a distinct challenge:

**How do students use AI to support research without undermining the fundamental purpose of research: original thinking, critical synthesis, and contribution to knowledge?**

This chapter addresses AI's role in research contexts: literature review, data analysis, research question development, and thesis writing. The goal is not to ban AI (impossible and counterproductive) but to teach students to use it as a **research assistant**, not a **research replacement**.

---

## The Core Principle: AI for Process, Human for Insight

AI can accelerate research **processes**:
- Finding relevant literature
- Summarizing large volumes of text
- Identifying patterns in qualitative data
- Checking methodology against standards
- Improving writing clarity

AI cannot replace research **insight**:
- Identifying significant gaps in knowledge
- Developing novel theoretical frameworks
- Making original arguments
- Synthesizing across disciplines creatively
- Evaluating quality and credibility of sources deeply

**The skill we're teaching:** Know when each applies.

---

## Application 1: Literature Review

### The Challenge

Postgraduate students must:
- Identify relevant literature across multiple disciplines
- Synthesize hundreds of sources
- Identify gaps and debates
- Position their own research contribution

This is time-consuming but essential scholarly work.

### How AI Can Help (Appropriately)

**Use Case 1: Exploratory Search**

When students are first entering a research area and don't yet know the key terms, debates, or seminal works:

```
PROMPT: Early Exploration

I'm beginning research on [topic: e.g., "employee engagement in remote
work environments"]. I have a general understanding of [what they know]
but need to understand the current state of research.

Help me identify:
1. The major theoretical frameworks used in this area
2. Key debates or controversies
3. Seminal authors or papers I should definitely read
4. Related concepts or search terms I should be aware of
5. Potential gaps this research area hasn't yet addressed

Do not write a literature review for me—just give me a map of the
landscape so I can read the original sources myself.
```

**What the student gets:** A starting point, not a finished product. They still must read the actual sources.

**Why this is acceptable:** It's like asking a senior researcher "Where should I start?" The student still does the intellectual work.

---

**Use Case 2: Source Summarization for Initial Screening**

When students have 50 potentially relevant articles and need to decide which ones are actually worth deep reading:

```
PROMPT: Initial Screening

I'm researching [specific research question]. I've identified this article:

[paste article abstract and key findings]

Based on this information:
1. Is this article directly relevant to my research question?
2. What is this article's main contribution?
3. What theoretical framework does it use?
4. What are its limitations relevant to my focus?

I will read the full article if it's relevant—this is just helping me
prioritize my reading list.
```

**What the student gets:** Efficient triaging. They still read the relevant sources fully.

**Why this is acceptable:** This is no different from reading abstracts first. The student is still making the judgment call about relevance.

---

### How AI Can Be Misused

**Problematic Use 1: "Write my literature review"**

```
BAD PROMPT: Write a 3000-word literature review on employee engagement
in remote work.
```

**Why it's problematic:**
- Student hasn't engaged with the literature
- AI will fabricate citations (hallucinate sources that don't exist)
- Student can't defend or explain the review
- No original synthesis or critical analysis

**How to prevent:**
- Require annotated bibliographies (forces engagement with sources)
- Require citation of specific page numbers and quotes
- Assess through oral examination or viva voce
- Ask students to explain contradictions or debates in their literature

---

**Problematic Use 2: Trusting AI's theoretical analysis**

AI can describe theories but often misapplies them or oversimplifies.

**Example:** AI might say "This study uses Social Exchange Theory" but miss that the study actually critiques or extends that theory in important ways.

**How to prevent:**
- Teach students to verify AI's theoretical claims against original sources
- Require students to identify where AI got theory wrong
- Assess theoretical sophistication through application, not just description

---

### Teaching Students Appropriate Literature Review with AI

**Assignment: Annotated Bibliography with AI Audit**

**Student Process:**
1. Use AI to identify 30 potentially relevant sources
2. Read abstracts and select 15 most relevant
3. Read all 15 sources fully
4. Write annotated bibliography (150 words per source):
   - Summary of contribution
   - Theoretical framework used
   - Methodology
   - Relevance to research question
   - Critical evaluation (strengths/limitations)
5. **AI Audit Section:**
   - Ask AI to summarize 3 of the same sources
   - Compare AI's summary to your own
   - Write 300 words: What did AI get right? What did it miss? What did it oversimplify?

**What this teaches:**
- Efficient source discovery (AI strength)
- Critical reading and evaluation (human strength)
- Awareness of AI's limitations in scholarly work

---

## Application 2: Research Question Development

### The Challenge

Developing a good research question is hard:
- Must be original (not already answered)
- Must be significant (worth answering)
- Must be feasible (answerable within scope/resources)
- Must be clear and focused

Students often struggle with scope—questions that are too broad or too narrow.

### How AI Can Help (Appropriately)

**Use Case: Refinement Through Questioning**

```
PROMPT: Research Question Refinement

I'm interested in researching: [broad topic]

My initial research question is: [their draft question]

Help me refine this by:
1. Asking clarifying questions about what exactly I want to know
2. Identifying what assumptions I'm making
3. Suggesting how I could narrow or focus the question
4. Identifying what would make this question more answerable

Do not write a research question for me—help me think through how to
develop a better one myself.
```

**What the student gets:** Socratic questioning that reveals fuzzy thinking.

**Why this is acceptable:** It's like supervision—a good supervisor asks probing questions that help the student clarify their own thinking.

---

**Use Case: Feasibility Check**

```
PROMPT: Feasibility Analysis

My research question is: [specific question]

I plan to answer this using [method: e.g., qualitative interviews with
15 HR managers in Perth].

Critically evaluate:
1. Is this method appropriate for answering this question? Why or why not?
2. What challenges might I face with this approach?
3. What alternative methods could I consider?
4. What would I need to establish to make this feasible (access, ethics,
   timeframe)?

Challenge my assumptions—don't just agree with me.
```

**What the student gets:** Critical feedback on methodology before they commit to an unworkable approach.

**Why this is acceptable:** Students still make the final decision. AI is playing devil's advocate.

---

### How AI Can Be Misused

**Problematic: "Generate research questions for me"**

If students simply ask AI to generate questions and choose one without deep engagement, they won't understand:
- Why the question matters
- What literature it's building on
- What the theoretical contribution would be

**How to prevent:**
- Require students to justify why their question is significant
- Ask: "What makes this question worth answering?"
- Require students to map their question to gaps in existing literature

---

## Application 3: Data Analysis (Qualitative Research)

### The Challenge

HR research often involves qualitative data: interviews, focus groups, open-ended survey responses. Analysis is time-consuming:
- Transcription
- Coding
- Theme identification
- Pattern recognition

### How AI Can Help (Appropriately)

**Use Case 1: Transcription**

AI transcription tools (Otter.ai, Whisper, etc.) can convert audio to text rapidly. This is **entirely appropriate**—transcription is mechanical work.

**Student responsibility:** Review and correct transcription (AI mishears technical terms, names, etc.).

---

**Use Case 2: Initial Coding Suggestions**

```
PROMPT: Preliminary Coding

I conducted interviews with HR managers about challenges in hybrid work
management. Below is one interview transcript.

My research question is: [specific question]

Suggest potential codes or themes you see emerging in this transcript.
This is preliminary—I will do my own coding, but I want a starting point
to see if I'm missing anything obvious.

[paste transcript]
```

**What the student gets:** Initial pattern recognition to compare against their own coding.

**Why this is acceptable:** The student still does the analytical work—deciding which codes are valid, refining them, applying them systematically across all data, and interpreting what they mean.

**Critical requirement:** Student must code independently FIRST, then compare to AI suggestions.

---

**Use Case 3: Checking for Bias in Interpretation**

```
PROMPT: Alternative Interpretations

I've identified this theme in my interview data: [theme description with
supporting quotes].

My interpretation is: [student's interpretation]

Challenge my interpretation:
1. What alternative ways could this data be interpreted?
2. What am I potentially overlooking or overemphasizing?
3. What assumptions might be driving my interpretation?

Help me ensure I'm not just seeing what I want to see in the data.
```

**What the student gets:** Check against confirmation bias.

**Why this is acceptable:** Good qualitative research includes reflexivity—questioning your own interpretations. This is like peer review or supervision feedback.

---

### How AI Can Be Misused

**Problematic: Outsourcing analysis entirely**

If AI does all the coding and theme identification, the student hasn't engaged with the data. They can't defend their findings or answer questions about them.

**How to prevent:**
- Require detailed coding tables showing student's own codes
- Require justification for theme selection (why this theme and not others?)
- Assess through viva voce where student must explain analytic choices
- Ask students to identify quotes/examples supporting each theme (demonstrates familiarity with data)

---

## Application 4: Thesis Writing

### The Challenge

Thesis writing requires:
- Clear argumentation
- Logical structure
- Academic writing conventions
- Integration of theory and findings
- Original synthesis

### How AI Can Help (Appropriately)

**Use Case 1: Structural Feedback**

```
PROMPT: Structural Critique

Below is an outline for my thesis chapter on [topic]:

[paste outline with main sections and subsections]

Evaluate:
1. Is the logical flow clear and coherent?
2. Are there obvious gaps in argumentation?
3. Does this structure effectively answer my research question?
4. What's unclear or confusing?

I'm looking for structural feedback, not content generation.
```

**What the student gets:** Feedback on organisation before investing time writing full drafts.

---

**Use Case 2: Clarity and Readability**

```
PROMPT: Clarity Check

Below is a paragraph from my thesis:

[paste paragraph]

This paragraph is trying to explain [what they're arguing].

Evaluate:
1. Is the main point clear?
2. Are there overly complex sentences that could be simplified?
3. Are there logical leaps that need additional explanation?
4. Suggest revisions for clarity—but maintain my voice and argument.
```

**What the student gets:** Editing suggestions focused on clarity, not content changes.

**Why this is acceptable:** It's like a writing centre consultation. The ideas are still the student's.

---

### How AI Can Be Misused

**Problematic 1: AI-written sections**

Students paste AI-generated prose into their thesis without engagement.

**How to detect:**
- AI-generated academic writing often uses generic phrases ("in today's rapidly changing world," "it is widely acknowledged that")
- Lacks specific engagement with the student's own data or sources
- Voice/style shifts noticeably between sections

**How to prevent:**
- Use the transparency model (Chapter 5)—students acknowledge AI use and submit revision history
- Assess through oral defense where students must explain their arguments
- Focus assessment on originality of thinking, not just quality of prose

---

**Problematic 2: Trusting AI citations**

AI frequently hallucinates citations—inventing papers that don't exist or misattributing real papers.

**How to prevent:**
- **Require students to verify every citation** in their reference list (confirm it exists, that they've read it, that it says what they claim)
- Spot-check citations during supervision: "Tell me about the Smith 2019 paper you cite here—what was their methodology?"

---

## Application 5: Research Proposal Development

### Assignment: MCom Research Proposal with AI Documentation

This assignment teaches appropriate AI use while maintaining academic rigor.

**Student Task:**

Develop a research proposal (2500 words) for an HR research project including:
1. Research question and justification
2. Literature review (15-20 sources)
3. Methodology and research design
4. Expected contributions

**AI Use Requirements:**

Students must document:
1. **Every AI interaction** used in developing this proposal (submit conversation logs or screenshots)
2. **AI Use Log** (template provided):
   - Date and purpose of AI use
   - Prompt used
   - What AI provided
   - How you critically evaluated or revised AI's output
   - What you learned from this AI interaction

**Assessment Rubric:**

| Criterion | Weight | What's Assessed |
|---|---|---|
| Research Question Quality | 20% | Originality, significance, feasibility |
| Literature Engagement | 25% | Depth of engagement with sources (not just AI summary) |
| Methodological Rigor | 25% | Appropriateness and detail of research design |
| Critical AI Use | 20% | Evidence of critical evaluation of AI outputs, not blind acceptance |
| Writing Quality | 10% | Clarity, structure, academic conventions |

**What This Teaches:**

- Transparency about AI use (professional practice)
- Critical evaluation of AI (essential skill)
- That AI is a tool requiring oversight (ethical responsibility)
- Appropriate vs. inappropriate research uses

---

## Teaching AI Literacy for Research

Explicitly teach these principles to postgraduate students:

### Principle 1: AI Accelerates Process, Humans Provide Insight

**Appropriate AI use:**
- Finding sources quickly
- Transcribing interviews
- Checking grammar
- Generating initial coding suggestions

**Inappropriate AI reliance:**
- Interpreting findings
- Making theoretical arguments
- Evaluating source quality deeply
- Making original contributions

---

### Principle 2: Always Verify

AI makes confident mistakes. For research, this is dangerous.

**Teach students:**
- Every citation AI provides must be verified (does it exist? Does it say what AI claims?)
- Every theoretical claim AI makes must be checked against original sources
- Every statistical claim must be recalculated or confirmed

**Assignment exercise:**
> "I gave AI 5 research questions and asked it to identify relevant literature. Below are AI's recommendations. Your task: Identify which citations are real and which are hallucinated. Verify each one."

This teaches verification as a habit.

---

### Principle 3: Use AI to Challenge Your Thinking

The best research use of AI is as a **critical friend**:
- "What assumptions am I making?"
- "What have I overlooked?"
- "How else could this be interpreted?"
- "What are weaknesses in my argument?"

Train students to prompt AI to **disagree** with them, not just confirm their thinking.

---

## Supervising Research Students Using AI

### As a Supervisor, You Should:

**1. Be Explicit About Expectations**

Include an "AI Use" section in your supervision agreement:
- When AI use is encouraged (e.g., literature search, transcription)
- When AI use must be documented (e.g., data analysis support)
- When AI use is inappropriate (e.g., writing original analysis)
- How to cite AI assistance in the thesis

**2. Model Appropriate AI Use**

In supervision meetings:
> "I used AI to quickly scan recent literature on your topic—here's what it flagged. But I want you to read these three papers fully because AI's summary missed important nuances."

This shows: AI for efficiency, human for depth.

**3. Ask Questions That Reveal AI Misuse**

If you suspect a student has outsourced thinking to AI:
- "Walk me through how you arrived at this interpretation."
- "What alternative explanations did you consider and reject? Why?"
- "Which of your sources best supports this claim? What does that author actually argue?"

Students who've done the work can answer. Students who relied on AI can't.

---

## Red Flags for Over-Reliance on AI in Research

**Red Flag 1:** Student's written work contains sophisticated arguments they can't explain verbally.

**Red Flag 2:** Citations that don't exist or don't say what the student claims.

**Red Flag 3:** Generic, surface-level literature review that doesn't engage with debates or contradictions.

**Red Flag 4:** Student can't articulate why their research question matters or what gap it fills.

**Red Flag 5:** Sudden shifts in writing quality or voice within a thesis.

**Response:** Don't accuse immediately. Ask questions that require genuine engagement with the research. Provide opportunity for the student to demonstrate their thinking.

## Key Principle for Postgraduate AI Integration

**The standard must be higher, not lower.**

Undergraduate students use AI to develop foundational skills.

Postgraduate students use AI to accelerate research processes while maintaining the highest standards of:
- Originality
- Critical thinking
- Methodological rigor
- Scholarly integrity

If AI integration makes postgraduate work easier without making it better, you're doing it wrong.

AI should enable students to engage with MORE literature, analyse data MORE thoroughly, and produce MORE rigorous research—not to avoid doing the hard thinking that research requires.

---

## Your Action Step

If you supervise research students or teach research methods:

1. **Draft an "AI in Research" policy** for your students (1 page):
   - What AI use is encouraged
   - What AI use requires documentation
   - What AI use is inappropriate
   - How to cite AI assistance

2. **Test it yourself:** Use AI appropriately in your own research. Experience its value and limitations firsthand.

3. **Have the conversation:** In your next supervision meeting, explicitly discuss AI use. Ask your students: "Have you tried using AI for your research? How? What worked? What didn't?"

Don't assume students will figure this out on their own. Teach it explicitly.

---

**Next Steps:** We now have comprehensive content covering undergraduate teaching, postgraduate research, unit design, and all core applications. Next we'll expand Chapter 3 with the Formative Assessment Generator technique, then create front matter and a conclusion chapter to complete the booklet.
