# Chapter 8: Your First Steps - A Practical Guide

## The Implementation Challenge

You've now seen what's possible with AI in HR education. You're probably feeling a mix of excitement and overwhelm.

The previous chapters showed you ambitious applications: conversation simulations, virtual companies, process-based assessments. But you're thinking: *"Where do I actually start? How do I introduce this to my students? What if it doesn't work?"*

This chapter is about **managing change**—both for yourself and your students. It provides a practical, phased implementation plan that starts small, builds confidence, and scales gradually.

**The key principle: Start with one small experiment, not a curriculum revolution.**

---

## Phase 1: Personal Experimentation (Before Your Next Class)

Before you introduce AI to students, you need to be comfortable with it yourself. This phase is about building your own confidence and discovering what works.

### Week 1: Your First Prompts

**Time investment: 1-2 hours**

**Task:** Generate three teaching resources you currently need using the techniques from Chapter 3.

**Examples:**
- Use the **Pros and Cons** technique to create a comparative analysis of performance review models (you can use this as lecture content or a discussion prompt)
- Use the **Role Play** technique to create a practice scenario for difficult conversations
- Use the **Reverse Prompting** technique to help you scope out a complex policy assignment

**Success metric:** You created at least one resource that's good enough to use in your teaching (even if it needs minor adjustments).

**What you'll learn:**
- How to write effective prompts for your specific content
- What AI does well and where it needs your expertise
- How to iterate and refine prompts to get better results

### Week 2: Test a Simulation

**Time investment: 30 minutes**

**Task:** Conduct a conversation simulation yourself using the Flight Simulator model from Chapter 4.

**Steps:**
1. Write a setup prompt for a scenario you teach (performance management, conflict resolution, recruitment interview, etc.)
2. Have the conversation with the AI—actually practice the skill yourself
3. Generate a critique of your performance using the debrief prompt

**Success metric:** The AI stayed in character throughout, and the critique provided specific, useful feedback.

**What you'll learn:**
- Whether your scenario design creates a realistic challenge
- How students will experience this exercise
- What kinds of feedback the AI generates (and whether it aligns with your standards)

### Week 3: Review Your Current Assessments

**Time investment: 1 hour**

**Task:** Look at your current assignments and identify which ones could be enhanced with AI.

**Questions to ask:**
- Which assignments currently test knowledge recall that could test applied process instead?
- Where do students struggle to get timely feedback?
- Which skills do students need more practice with before assessment?
- What do you wish you had time to grade more thoroughly?

**Success metric:** You've identified one specific assignment that you'll pilot in the next teaching cycle.

**What you'll learn:**
- Where AI can add the most value in your specific context
- What problems you're actually trying to solve (not just "use AI because it's new")

## Phase 2: Low-Stakes Student Introduction (First Month of Semester)

You're now ready to introduce AI to students. Start with optional, low-stakes activities—not high-stakes assessments.

### Approach 1: Optional Practice Exercise

**What to do:**

Introduce AI as a **practice tool** for an upcoming assignment.

**Example announcement to students:**

> "For the case study assignment due in Week 8, I want to give you a chance to practice your analytical skills first. I've created an AI critique prompt that you can use to check your draft before submission.
>
> Here's how it works: Write your draft analysis, paste it into ChatGPT or Claude along with this critique prompt [provide prompt], and see what feedback you get. Then revise based on the feedback.
>
> This is completely optional—I won't know whether you used it or not. But I encourage you to try it at least once to see if it helps you improve your work."

**Why this works:**
- No pressure—students who are skeptical can ignore it
- Students who try it will likely see value and spread the word to peers
- You can gauge student response before making it mandatory
- You avoid the "forced adoption" resistance

### Approach 2: In-Class Demonstration

**What to do:**

During a lecture, demonstrate AI in action as a teaching tool.

**Example:**

> "Today we're learning about procedural fairness in disciplinary processes. Let me show you something interesting. I'm going to ask an AI to role-play an employee going through a disciplinary meeting, and I want you to watch and critique my process."

Then conduct a live conversation with the AI projected on screen. Students observe and analyse your performance in real-time.

**Follow-up:**
- Ask students: "What did I do well? What did I miss?"
- Show how AI can provide a critique: paste the transcript into the critique prompt live
- Discuss: "Did the AI catch the same things you did? Did it miss anything?"

**Why this works:**
- Demystifies AI (students see it's just a tool, not magic)
- Models critical thinking about AI outputs
- Shows your own willingness to be vulnerable and learn
- Sparks curiosity about trying it themselves

### Approach 3: Reflective Exercise

**What to do:**

Assign a short, reflective writing task where students *experiment with* AI rather than complete a traditional assignment.

**Example assignment:**

> **Assignment: Exploring AI as an HR Tool (5% of grade)**
>
> **Task:**
> 1. Choose one HR skill we've covered this semester (e.g., conducting an investigation, drafting a policy, analysing turnover data)
> 2. Use an AI tool (ChatGPT, Claude, or similar) to help you practice or analyse that skill
> 3. Write a 500-word reflection answering:
>    - What task did you ask the AI to help with?
>    - What was useful about the AI's response?
>    - What was wrong, missing, or oversimplified in the AI's response?
>    - How would you use (or not use) AI for this kind of task in professional practice?
>
> **Grading:** You're being graded on your critical reflection, not on the AI's performance. Honest critique of AI's limitations will score higher than uncritical praise.

**Why this works:**
- Low stakes (only 5% of grade)
- Emphasizes critical thinking about AI rather than reliance on AI
- Introduces AI literacy as a learning objective
- Gives you insight into how students are using AI

---

## Phase 3: Pilot Assessment (Mid-Semester)

After students have some familiarity with AI, introduce one AI-enhanced assessment. Choose something meaningful but not the highest-stakes assignment.

### Implementation Checklist

**Before you launch:**

- [ ] You've tested the prompts yourself thoroughly
- [ ] You've created clear student instructions (what to do, how to do it, what's expected)
- [ ] You've prepared a FAQ document anticipating student questions
- [ ] You've decided how much this is worth (recommend 15-25% of final grade for first pilot)
- [ ] You've built in time for technical issues (some students will need help accessing AI tools)

**Choose your model:**

Based on Chapters 4-7, select one approach for a **single assignment**:

**Option A: Conversation Simulation + Reflection** (Chapter 4)
- Lower workload for grading
- Students are most likely to find this engaging
- Easiest to explain

**Option B: Self-Assessment with Transparency Model** (Chapter 5)
- Works for existing essay/case study assignments
- Minimal restructuring needed
- Good introduction to AI literacy

**Option C: AI Critique and Override** (Chapter 7, Model 3)
- Medium complexity
- Strong focus on critical thinking
- Clear demonstration of learning

**Don't choose:** Virtual company simulation (Chapter 6) or complex multi-part process assessment (Chapter 7, Models 1-2) for your first pilot. Save those for when you have more experience.

---

**Thinking bigger than a single assignment?**

If you're ready to redesign an entire unit from the ground up rather than piloting a single assignment, see **Chapter 10: Designing an AI-Integrated Unit** for a complete backwards design framework. That chapter shows how to:
- Map AI integration across a full 12-week semester
- Build scaffolded progression from Week 1 to Week 12
- Balance AI-enhanced and traditional learning activities
- Support student AI literacy development throughout the unit

**Most lecturers should start with a single assignment pilot before attempting whole-unit redesign.** Once you've successfully piloted one AI-enhanced assignment and gathered student feedback, you'll be in a much stronger position to expand your approach across an entire unit.

### Launch Week: Student Orientation

**Dedicate 15-20 minutes of class time to:**

1. **Explain the "why"**
   > "We're trying something new with this assignment because I want you to practice professional skills, not just write about them. In HR work, you'll use AI tools, so learning to use them critically is part of your education."

2. **Address the anxiety**
   > "Some of you might be worried this is too technical—it's not. If you can copy and paste text, you can do this assignment. Some of you might be thinking this makes things easier—actually, it makes things harder, because I'm assessing your thinking process, not just your final answer."

3. **Do a live demo**
   - Show exactly how to access the AI tool
   - Show exactly how to paste the prompt
   - Show exactly what happens next
   - Show what they submit to you

4. **Open for questions**

5. **Provide written instructions**
   - Create a one-page step-by-step guide students can refer back to
   - Include screenshots if needed
   - Provide a technical support contact (could be you, a TA, or IT support)

### During the Assignment Period: Be Available

**Common student issues:**

**"The AI isn't staying in character"**
→ Response: Check that you copied the full prompt. Try starting a fresh conversation.

**"The AI gave me weird feedback"**
→ Response: That's possible—AI can make errors. In your reflection, explain what the AI got wrong and why. You'll get credit for catching the error.

**"I don't have access to ChatGPT"**
→ Response: Try Claude.ai instead, or come to office hours and we can run it together.

**"Is this even allowed? Am I cheating?"**
→ Response: Yes, it's allowed—this is the assignment. You're being graded on your critical use of AI, not on avoiding it.

### After Submission: Grading Efficiently

**Create a grading workflow:**

1. **Quick initial scan** (5 minutes per student)
   - Did they follow instructions?
   - Did they submit all required components?
   - Any obvious red flags (e.g., obviously didn't do the work)?

2. **Deep assessment** (15-20 minutes per student)
   - Review the transcript/analysis/reflection against your rubric
   - Look for evidence of learning and critical thinking
   - Provide targeted feedback (2-3 specific comments)

3. **Use standard comment banks**
   - Create a document with common feedback phrases you can copy-paste
   - Examples: "Strong application of procedural fairness here," "This needed more specific evidence from the transcript," "Excellent critique of AI's oversight"

**Time-saving tip:** Use AI itself to help with initial feedback:

**Your prompt to AI:**
```
You are assisting with grading. Review this student's submission against
the rubric [paste rubric]. Provide an initial assessment and draft
feedback comments.

I will review your assessment and make final decisions—do not assign
final grades, just provide recommendations.

[paste student work]
```

Then you review AI's suggestions, adjust where needed, and add your own judgment. This can cut grading time by 30-40%.

---

## Phase 4: Gather Feedback and Iterate (End of Semester)

After students submit the pilot assessment, collect structured feedback.

### Student Survey (5 minutes for students to complete)

**Questions to ask:**

1. How useful was AI for learning in this assignment? (1-5 scale)
2. What worked well about using AI for this task?
3. What was confusing or frustrating?
4. Would you want to use AI in future assignments? Why or why not?
5. Do you feel this assignment helped you develop practical HR skills? (1-5 scale)
6. Any other comments or suggestions?

### Self-Reflection Questions (For You)

1. **Effectiveness:** Did students demonstrate deeper learning than in previous traditional assignments?
2. **Efficiency:** Did this save me grading time or cost me more time?
3. **Engagement:** Were students more engaged with this format?
4. **Technical issues:** What problems came up and how can I prevent them next time?
5. **Learning objectives:** Did this actually assess what I wanted to assess?
6. **Would I do this again?** If yes, what would I change?

### Iterate for Next Time

Based on feedback, make 2-3 specific changes:

**Common adjustments:**

**Issue:** Students found the prompts confusing
**Fix:** Simplify language, provide an example of a completed submission

**Issue:** AI feedback was too generic
**Fix:** Revise the critique prompt to be more specific about criteria

**Issue:** Some students didn't take it seriously (minimal effort)
**Fix:** Increase the grade weight or add more structured reflection requirements

**Issue:** Grading took longer than expected
**Fix:** Provide templates/checklists that students complete, making your review faster

## Phase 5: Expand and Integrate (Next Semester)

You've now completed one successful pilot. Next semester, you can:

### Option 1: Refine and Repeat

Use the same AI-enhanced assignment but with improvements based on feedback. Consistency across semesters builds institutional knowledge and reduces your prep time.

### Option 2: Add a Second AI Component

Introduce one more AI element:
- If you started with self-assessment (Chapter 5), add a conversation simulation (Chapter 4)
- If you started with conversation simulation, add a process-based assessment (Chapter 7)

### Option 3: Go Deeper with Existing Component

Make your existing AI assignment more sophisticated:
- Add multiple personas (move from Level 1 to Level 2 simulation)
- Add persistent context (students have follow-up conversations)
- Increase complexity of analysis required

## Managing Common Challenges

### Challenge 1: Resistance from Students

**"This is unfair—I didn't sign up for an AI class"**

**Response:**
> "I understand this is different. But in HR work, you'll use AI tools whether you like them or not. My job is to prepare you for professional practice, and that now includes knowing when and how to use AI responsibly. I'm not asking you to become an AI expert—just to be a critical user."

**"I don't trust AI / I think AI is unethical"**

**Response:**
> "That's actually a valuable perspective. This assignment is a chance for you to critically evaluate AI's limitations and biases. In fact, students who identify what AI gets wrong often score highest, because that demonstrates critical thinking. You don't have to like AI—you just need to understand it."

### Challenge 2: Resistance from Colleagues

**"You're just making things easier for students"**

**Response:**
> "Actually, it's harder—students can't just memorize and regurgitate anymore. They have to think critically and demonstrate process. The AI doesn't give them answers; it creates dynamic challenges they have to navigate."

**"AI feedback isn't as good as human feedback"**

**Response:**
> "You're right—that's why I'm still grading the final work. But AI feedback is instant and available 24/7. Students can practice and revise multiple times before submission. That's pedagogically valuable even if AI feedback isn't perfect."

**"What about academic integrity?"**

**Response:**
> "This approach actually makes cheating harder. I'm assessing their process and critical thinking, not just final answers. And by teaching students to use AI transparently, I'm building integrity rather than policing violations."

### Challenge 3: Technology Failures

**"The AI platform was down during the assignment period"**

**Students affected:** Build in flexibility—allow extensions or alternative submission methods if technical issues occur.

**Prevention:** Provide multiple AI tool options (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) so students have backups.

### Challenge 4: Uneven Student Access

**"Some students don't have reliable internet or devices"**

**Solutions:**
- Provide lab time where students can complete the assignment on campus
- Offer office hours where you can facilitate the AI interaction together
- Check if your university has institutional AI tool subscriptions
- Design assignments that can be completed in short sessions (don't require hours of continuous AI access)

### Challenge 5: You're Overwhelmed

**"This is taking more time than expected and I'm drowning"**

**Emergency strategies:**
- Reduce the weight of the AI assignment (make it formative, not summative)
- Make reflection/analysis shorter (250 words instead of 500)
- Grade on completion rather than detailed quality for this first round
- Ask for teaching assistant support if available
- Remember: It gets easier the second time

**Long-term:** Building AI-enhanced assignments is front-loaded work. Year 1 is significant effort. Year 2 is refinement. Year 3 is almost autopilot.

## Measuring Success

How do you know if this is working? Look for these indicators:

**Student learning:**
- Higher quality of work on related assessments
- Students citing practical experiences ("when I practiced the conversation simulation...") in reflections
- Fewer students making basic procedural errors
- More sophisticated understanding of HR complexity

**Student engagement:**
- Students asking for more AI-enhanced activities
- Positive feedback in course evaluations
- Students reporting the work felt "more real" than traditional assignments

**Your satisfaction:**
- You feel less like you're testing memorization and more like you're developing professionals
- Grading feels more meaningful (you're assessing thinking, not checking answers)
- You're excited about teaching this topic again

**Practical outcomes:**
- Employers or practicum supervisors comment that your graduates are better prepared
- Students successfully transfer skills to work placements
- Alumni report that the AI-enhanced assignments were among the most useful parts of their degree

## Final Encouragement

Implementing AI in your teaching isn't about being a tech enthusiast or an early adopter. It's about being a committed educator who wants students to be genuinely prepared for professional practice.

You don't need to revolutionize your entire curriculum overnight. You don't need to be perfect. You just need to start.

**Your first AI-enhanced assignment will be imperfect. Do it anyway.**

You'll discover what works in your context, with your students, for your content. Every lecturer's implementation will look slightly different—and that's exactly right.

The chapters before this showed you what's possible. This chapter showed you how to make it real.

Now it's time to choose your first small experiment and try it.

---

**Next Chapter Preview:** In Chapter 9, we directly address the academic integrity and ethics question. You'll learn how to talk to students about AI use, how to design assignments that minimise misuse while maximizing learning, and how to reframe "preventing AI cheating" as "teaching AI literacy and professional ethics." This is the conversation you'll need to have with students, colleagues, and possibly administrators.
