# Chapter 6: Virtual Company Simulation (Future Horizon)

## The Big Idea

Imagine this: Your students don't just read case studies about HR challenges—they actually work as HR professionals in a simulated company where they interact with AI-powered employees, managers, and stakeholders over weeks or even an entire semester.

They receive complaints, conduct investigations, negotiate with union representatives, handle performance issues, and make strategic recommendations. Each interaction builds on previous ones. The "employees" remember past conversations. The company has policies, culture, and ongoing challenges.

**This is the virtual company simulation—the most ambitious application of AI in HR education.**

It's more complex than a single conversation simulation, but it's increasingly feasible with current AI technology. This chapter will show you how to build toward this vision progressively, starting simple and adding layers of complexity.

## Why This Matters

Traditional case studies are static snapshots. Students analyse what *already happened* and recommend what *should have happened*. But HR work is dynamic:

- You don't get all the information at once
- Your decisions have consequences that unfold over time
- Stakeholders react to your actions
- You must navigate politics, personalities, and competing priorities simultaneously

A virtual company simulation creates **emergent complexity** where students experience these dynamics. They don't just know *about* HR work—they practice *doing* HR work in a realistic context.

## The Progressive Implementation Model

You don't need to build the entire virtual company at once. Start simple and add complexity as you and your students become comfortable.

### Level 1: Single Employee Persona (Master Prompt)
### Level 2: Multiple Employee Personas (Cast of Characters)
### Level 3: Persistent Context (Company Memory)
### Level 4: Dynamic Events (Evolving Scenarios)

Let's explore each level.

---

## Level 1: Single Employee Persona (Master Prompt)

This is the simplest version—essentially an enhanced version of the conversation simulation from Chapter 4, but with richer organisational context.

### The Master Prompt Template

```
You are Jamie Martinez, a customer service team leader at "InnovateCo," a
mid-sized technology company based in Perth, Western Australia.

COMPANY CONTEXT:
InnovateCo employs 300 people across three departments: Product Development,
Sales & Marketing, and Customer Success. The company has experienced rapid
growth over the past two years, and the HR infrastructure is struggling to
keep up. There is no formal HR department—just a single HR Manager (Sarah)
and an external HR consultant who is brought in for complex issues.

The company culture values innovation and autonomy but has weak processes
for performance management and conflict resolution. Most managers, including
your supervisor (David Chen, Head of Customer Success), have had minimal
management training.

JAMIE'S BACKGROUND:
- 28 years old, has worked at InnovateCo for 18 months
- Promoted to team leader 6 months ago (manages 5 customer service
  representatives)
- Previously worked in customer service roles at two other companies
- Generally competent but inexperienced in people management
- Feels pressure to meet aggressive customer satisfaction targets

CURRENT SITUATION:
One of Jamie's team members, Priya, has complained to senior management
about Jamie's "micromanagement" and "unfair treatment." Priya claims that
Jamie monitors her work more closely than others, criticizes her more
harshly, and has denied her flexible work requests that were granted to
other team members.

Jamie believes Priya is being oversensitive and that the extra attention
is justified because Priya's customer satisfaction scores are lower than
the team average. Jamie is frustrated that Priya "went over my head"
instead of talking to Jamie directly.

JAMIE'S PERSONA:
- Defensive but not hostile
- Genuinely believes they're doing their job correctly
- Doesn't understand why this is being treated as a serious HR issue
- Slightly resentful that other managers don't face this kind of scrutiny
- Will become more open if treated with respect and genuine curiosity
- Has not received any training in managing diverse teams or performance
  discussions

YOUR ROLE:
I am the HR Consultant who has been brought in to investigate Priya's
complaint and provide coaching to Jamie. This is our first meeting.

Stay in character as Jamie. Respond to my questions and statements
realistically. Do not break character unless I say "END SIMULATION."

I will begin the meeting now.
```

### How Students Use This

**Assignment Structure:**
1. Students receive the Master Prompt and the assignment brief
2. They conduct an initial meeting with Jamie (the investigation interview)
3. They submit the transcript along with a written report recommending next steps
4. They explain their HR methodology and justify their recommendations

**What This Teaches:**
- Conducting a fair, unbiased investigation interview
- Asking open-ended questions
- Identifying when additional perspectives are needed
- Recognizing the difference between perception and fact
- Avoiding premature conclusions

**Assessment Focus:**
Did the student:
- Establish rapport and psychological safety?
- Ask questions that elicited Jamie's full perspective?
- Avoid leading questions or showing bias toward the complainant?
- Identify what other information is needed (interviewing Priya, reviewing policies, checking documentation)?
- Recognize the underlying issues (inadequate management training, unclear performance standards)?

---

## Level 2: Multiple Employee Personas (Cast of Characters)

Now we add complexity: students interact with multiple AI personas representing different stakeholders in the same scenario. This simulates the reality that HR professionals must gather multiple perspectives and navigate competing interests.

### Scenario: The Performance Management Conflict

**The Company:** Still InnovateCo (same as Level 1)

**The Situation:** The complaint about Jamie's management of Priya

**The Cast:**
1. **Jamie Martinez** (Team Leader) - believes they're managing performance appropriately
2. **Priya Patel** (Customer Service Rep) - believes she's being unfairly targeted
3. **David Chen** (Head of Customer Success) - Jamie's manager, wants this resolved quickly
4. **Sarah Kim** (HR Manager) - overworked, risk-averse, wants to avoid legal issues

### Creating the Cast

You create four separate Master Prompts—one for each character. Each prompt includes:
- The shared company context (so all personas are consistent)
- The specific character's background and perspective
- What that character knows and doesn't know
- Their goals and concerns
- How they're likely to behave in conversations

**Example: Priya's Master Prompt**

```
You are Priya Patel, a customer service representative at InnovateCo.

[COMPANY CONTEXT - same as Jamie's prompt above]

PRIYA'S BACKGROUND:
- 26 years old, has worked at InnovateCo for 2 years
- One of the first customer service reps hired; has seen the team grow
  from 3 people to 8
- Generally receives positive customer feedback but has lower customer
  satisfaction scores than team average (72% vs. team average of 81%)
- Has a 4-year-old child; needs flexible start times 2-3 days per week
  for childcare dropoff

PRIYA'S PERSPECTIVE ON THE SITUATION:
- Believes Jamie singles her out for criticism while praising other team
  members for similar work
- Feels Jamie monitors her more closely (more frequent check-ins, reviews
  her tickets more thoroughly)
- Requested flexible start times (9:30am instead of 9:00am) two days per
  week, which Jamie denied, saying "customer calls start at 9am." However,
  Priya knows that Marcus and Lee both have flexible schedules.
- Believes Jamie has "had it in for her" since Jamie became team leader
  6 months ago
- Did not initially complain to Jamie because she was worried about
  retaliation
- Escalated to senior management (David Chen) after feeling the situation
  wasn't improving

WHAT PRIYA DOESN'T KNOW:
- Marcus and Lee's flexible arrangements were approved because they work
  evening shifts (until 7pm) while Priya's contracted hours are 9am-5pm
- Jamie is under pressure from David to improve the team's overall customer
  satisfaction scores
- Jamie has received feedback from David specifically about Priya's
  performance gaps

PRIYA'S PERSONA:
- Frustrated and feeling undervalued
- Worried about job security (is this a prelude to being fired?)
- Emotional but trying to remain professional
- Defensive about her performance (believes her scores are "fine" and
  doesn't understand why Jamie focuses on them)
- Will become tearful if she feels dismissed or not believed
- Will be more forthcoming if treated with empathy and fairness

YOUR ROLE:
I am the HR Consultant investigating the complaint. This is our
confidential interview.

Stay in character as Priya. Respond realistically. Do not break character
unless I say "END SIMULATION."

I will begin now.
```

### The Multi-Persona Assignment

**Student Task:**
You are the external HR Consultant. You must:

1. **Conduct individual interviews** with all four stakeholders (Jamie, Priya, David, Sarah)
2. **Analyze the evidence** from all perspectives
3. **Write an investigation report** that includes:
   - Summary of each person's account
   - Analysis of factual discrepancies
   - Identification of underlying systemic issues
   - Recommended resolution with justification
4. **Submit all transcripts** along with your report

**What This Teaches:**
- Managing complex investigations with conflicting accounts
- Identifying bias in different perspectives
- Recognizing systemic issues (weak management processes) vs. individual problems
- Balancing fairness to all parties
- Synthesizing multiple data sources

**The Challenge:**
Each persona will give a different version of events. Students must:
- Identify what's factual vs. interpretive
- Recognize what information is missing
- Ask probing questions to uncover hidden context
- Avoid prematurely siding with one party

This mirrors real HR work where truth is rarely simple.

## Level 3: Persistent Context (Company Memory)

This level adds continuity: the AI personas remember previous interactions. Decisions have consequences that affect future conversations.

### Technical Approach

Most AI platforms now support "conversation history" or "memory." You can:

**Option A: Single Long Conversation**
Students have one ongoing AI conversation that spans weeks. Each new interaction builds on what came before.

**Option B: Context Injection**
At the start of each new conversation, students paste a "context summary" of previous interactions:

```
CONTEXT FROM PREVIOUS INTERACTIONS:

Week 2: You (Jamie) met with the HR Consultant (student). You explained
your perspective on managing Priya. You expressed frustration that Priya
went to senior management. The HR Consultant asked about your management
training and flexible work policy understanding.

Week 3: The HR Consultant met with Priya, David, and Sarah. You haven't
seen the consultant since Week 2.

Week 4 (NOW): The HR Consultant is meeting with you again to discuss their
findings and recommendations.

Use this context to inform your responses. Remember what you previously
discussed with the consultant.
```

### Sequential Assignment Example

**Week 1-2: Investigation Phase**
Students conduct interviews with all stakeholders (Level 2 approach)

**Week 3-4: Resolution Design**
Students draft a resolution plan (training for Jamie, revised flexible work policy, mediation between Jamie and Priya)

**Week 5-6: Implementation Simulation**
Students have follow-up conversations with Jamie and Priya to implement the plan. The AI personas react based on:
- How well the student conducted the initial investigation
- Whether the resolution plan seems fair
- How the student communicates and manages the process

**Week 7: Evaluation**
Students have final check-in conversations 30 days later to assess whether the situation has improved. Jamie and Priya provide feedback on the process.

### What This Teaches

- **Longitudinal thinking**: HR interventions aren't one-time fixes
- **Change management**: People resist or embrace change based on how it's handled
- **Accountability**: Students see the consequences of their decisions
- **Iteration**: If the initial approach doesn't work, they must adapt

### Example: Persistent Consequences

**Scenario 1: Student handled investigation poorly**

*Student in Week 5 attempts a follow-up meeting with Priya:*

**Student:** "Hi Priya, I wanted to check in and see how things are going since we implemented the new flexible work schedule."

**AI (as Priya):** *crosses arms, speaks curtly* "It's fine, I guess. The schedule helps. But honestly, I still don't feel like the investigation really listened to my concerns. The report made it sound like this was all just a misunderstanding about policies, but it felt like more than that to me. Anyway, what's done is done."

The AI remembers that the student's report was superficial and didn't validate Priya's experience. This affects the ongoing relationship.

**Scenario 2: Student handled investigation well**

**Student:** "Hi Priya, I wanted to check in and see how things are going since we implemented the new flexible work schedule."

**AI (as Priya):** *smiles cautiously* "Actually, it's been better. The flexible start times have made a huge difference with childcare. And Jamie and I had that mediation session you set up—it was awkward, but I think we both understand each other better now. I feel like someone actually took this seriously, which means a lot."

The AI remembers that the student was thorough, empathetic, and fair. This builds trust.

---

## Level 4: Dynamic Events (Evolving Scenarios)

The most advanced level: the virtual company has ongoing developments that aren't tied to any single student's actions. The environment evolves, creating new challenges.

### How It Works

You (the lecturer) inject new developments into the company context periodically:

**Week 6 Announcement:**
```
COMPANY UPDATE:

InnovateCo has just been acquired by a larger tech firm. The new parent
company has announced that there will be a "strategic restructuring" and
that all positions will be reviewed. Employees are anxious about job
security.

This context now affects all personas:
- Priya is worried her complaint has made her a target for redundancy
- Jamie is worried that management issues will count against them in the
  restructuring
- David is under pressure to ensure his department is seen as high-performing
- Sarah (HR Manager) is fielding constant questions about the restructuring
  process

When students interact with these characters, the personas should reflect
this new context and heightened anxiety.
```

### Why This Is Powerful

Students must now manage:
- The original performance/conflict issue
- New uncertainty and change management
- Employee anxiety and rumor control
- Ethical questions (is it fair to continue performance management during restructuring?)

This creates **emergent complexity** that mirrors real organisational life, where HR professionals must juggle multiple priorities and adapt to changing circumstances.

### Semester-Long Virtual Company Project

**The Ultimate Application:**

Create a semester-long project where students act as the HR team for a virtual company. Each week brings new developments:

| Week | Event | Student Task |
|---|---|---|
| 1-2 | Introduction to InnovateCo, cast of characters | Conduct organisational culture assessment |
| 3-4 | Performance management complaint (Jamie/Priya) | Investigate and resolve |
| 5-6 | Employee requests union representation | Respond to union inquiry, prepare for negotiation |
| 7-8 | Diversity audit reveals gender pay gap | Analyse data, recommend corrective action |
| 9-10 | Acquisition announced, restructuring begins | Manage change communication, handle redundancies |
| 11-12 | Post-restructure morale crisis | Design retention and engagement strategy |

Students work in teams (acting as the HR department). All teams interact with the same personas, but the personas respond differently based on each team's approach.

---

## Practical Implementation Guidance

### Starting Small

You don't need to build an entire semester-long simulation right away. Start with:

1. **One scenario, one persona** (Level 1) - Use this for a single assignment or in-class exercise
2. **Get student feedback** - Did they find it realistic? Useful? Engaging?
3. **Add complexity gradually** - Next semester, try multi-persona (Level 2)
4. **Build your library** - Create a collection of tested personas and scenarios you can reuse and refine

### Creating Consistent Personas

The key to realistic simulation is **consistency**. Tips:

- **Write detailed persona documents** that you keep for reference
- **Test personas yourself** before giving them to students
- **Update personas based on student interactions** (if students discover something that breaks the character, revise the prompt)
- **Use the same company/context** across multiple scenarios to build familiarity

### Technical Options

**Low-Tech Option:**
Students copy-paste the Master Prompt into ChatGPT or Claude themselves. Free, simple, no special tools needed.

**Mid-Tech Option:**
Create a shared document library with all persona prompts. Students access them as needed.

**High-Tech Option (Future):**
Work with your university's IT department to create a custom web interface where students click on an employee's name and start a conversation. The prompts are pre-loaded and invisible to students. This feels more like a professional simulation.

### Assessment Approaches

**What to Assess:**

1. **Conversation Quality** (the transcripts themselves)
   - Did they ask good questions?
   - Did they demonstrate HR competencies?
   - Did they maintain professionalism?

2. **Written Analysis** (reports, reflections, recommendations)
   - Can they synthesize information from multiple sources?
   - Do they apply theory and legal principles?
   - Are their recommendations realistic and justified?

3. **Process Documentation** (how they approached the task)
   - What was their methodology?
   - How did they ensure fairness?
   - What would they do differently?

**Grading Rubric Example:**

| Criterion | Weight | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Investigation Process | 25% | Quality of questions, fairness, thoroughness |
| Stakeholder Management | 20% | Rapport-building, empathy, professionalism |
| Analysis & Synthesis | 25% | Ability to integrate multiple perspectives and identify underlying issues |
| Recommendations | 20% | Practical, justified, legally sound solutions |
| Reflection | 10% | Metacognitive awareness, learning demonstrated |

## Common Questions

**Q: Won't students compare notes and just copy each other's approaches?**

A: The beauty of AI personas is that they respond dynamically. Even if two students use similar approaches, their conversations will diverge based on specific wording, tone, and follow-up questions. Additionally, you're grading the quality of their thinking and justification, not just whether they got a particular outcome.

**Q: What if a student gets "stuck" and the conversation goes nowhere?**

A: Build a "reset" option into the assignment. Students can restart the conversation once if needed, but they must reflect on why the first attempt failed. This teaches recovery from mistakes—an important professional skill.

**Q: How much time does this take to set up?**

A: Initial setup for Level 1 (single persona): 1-2 hours to write a detailed Master Prompt and test it.

Level 2 (multiple personas): 3-4 hours to create the full cast and ensure consistency.

Level 3-4: Ongoing time investment, but you're building reusable assets.

**Q: Can I use the same scenarios year after year?**

A: Yes! Unlike traditional case studies that students might find online, AI simulations are dynamic—each student's experience is unique. However, you should refresh and refine your prompts based on what you learn from each cohort.

## The Vision: HR Education Transformed

Imagine your graduates leaving university having:

- Conducted dozens of difficult conversations in safe, realistic environments
- Managed complex investigations with conflicting accounts
- Made strategic HR decisions and seen their consequences unfold
- Practiced recovery from mistakes without real-world harm
- Developed confidence in their professional judgment

This is what virtual company simulations can achieve. It's not replacing traditional teaching—it's adding a layer of experiential learning that was previously impossible at scale.

---

## Your Action Step

Before Chapter 7, decide your level of ambition:

**Conservative Start:** Create one Level 1 persona (single character) for a single assignment. Test it in one class.

**Moderate Start:** Create a Level 2 scenario (3-4 personas) for a major assignment worth 20-30% of the final grade.

**Ambitious Start:** Design a semester-long Level 3 simulation with persistent context across multiple assignments.

Choose what feels manageable for your current teaching load and technical comfort level. You can always scale up later.

---

**Next Chapter Preview:** In Chapter 7, we shift from "how to use AI tools" to "how to rethink assessment." We'll explore the fundamental difference between assessing **process** (professional methodology) versus **product** (theoretical knowledge), and show you three complete assessment models specifically designed for HR education: the Simulated HR Consultation, the Evidence-Based Strategic Intervention Plan, and the Competency-Based Recruitment Portfolio. This is where AI-enhanced teaching transforms into AI-enhanced assessment.
