# About This Booklet

This booklet is designed for business lecturers across all disciplines who want to enhance their teaching with Artificial Intelligence but don't consider themselves "tech people."

You won't need to code, install complex software, or understand how AI works technically. What you will learn is how to use simple, plain-language instructions (called "prompts") to create powerful learning experiences for your students.

## Who This Is For

- Business lecturers at Curtin University teaching undergraduate or postgraduate students
- Academics in business, marketing, management, tourism, accounting, economics, information systems, and supply chain
- Unit coordinators exploring AI integration aligned with learning outcomes
- Research supervisors supporting business students
- Anyone curious about practical, non-technical AI applications in business education

### Discipline-Specific Pathways

This booklet is designed for multiple business disciplines. While the core principles and techniques are universal, examples and prompts are tailored to your field:

# How to Use This Booklet

## If you're completely new to AI:
Start with **Chapter 1** (motivation) and **Chapter 2** (your first AI conversation). Work through the basics before exploring advanced applications.

## If you want to implement AI in your teaching:
Read **Chapter 3** (your first steps) for a practical implementation plan. Then move to **Chapter 4** (six essential techniques) and pick one to try immediately. Refer to **Appendix A** for copy-paste prompts.

## If you're designing assessments:
Read **Chapter 8** (process-based assessment models) and **Chapter 10** (complete unit design). Use these frameworks to redesign existing assignments.

## If you teach postgraduate students:
Focus on **Chapter 11** (AI as research assistant) for guidance on appropriate AI use in research contexts.

## If you're presenting to colleagues:
Use **Appendix B** (one-hour faculty workshop guide) as a facilitation template.

## If you need institutional justification:
Refer to **Appendix C** (alignment with Curtin learning outcomes) to demonstrate how AI integration supports existing educational goals.

# The Core Philosophy

Three principles underpin everything in this booklet:

**1. AI as Scaffolding, Not Replacement**

You are the expert educator. AI is a tool that helps you scale what you already know works—personalized practice, immediate feedback, realistic simulations. AI builds the framework quickly; you ensure it's pedagogically sound and academically rigorous.

*How this applies to your discipline:*

::: {.panel-tabset}

# Business & Marketing
AI generates competitive analysis frameworks and customer segmentation scenarios. You validate the business logic, ensure market assumptions are sound, and teach students to question data sources and market trends.

# Management
AI creates organizational scenarios and change management workflows. You ensure they reflect real organizational complexity, teach students about stakeholder dynamics, and guide reflection on ethical leadership implications.

# Human Resources
AI generates candidate profiles and HR scenarios. You ensure they reflect realistic workplace situations, teach students about bias in hiring, and guide ethical decision-making about employee relations.

# Tourism & Hospitality
AI creates customer journey scenarios and service recovery simulations. You ensure they reflect authentic tourism contexts, teach cultural sensitivity, and guide experience design thinking.

# Supply Chain
AI generates demand forecasts and logistics scenarios. You validate the economic logic, teach supply chain trade-offs, and guide systems thinking about global complexity.

# Information Systems
AI generates system requirements and IT scenarios. You ensure technical feasibility, teach about legacy system constraints, and guide project management realities.

# Accounting & Finance
AI generates financial scenarios and compliance workflows. You ensure accuracy, teach professional standards, and guide ethical judgment in ambiguous situations.

# Economics
AI generates economic scenarios and policy simulations. You ensure theoretical soundness, teach empirical rigor, and guide students to understand limitations of models.

**2. Transparency Over Prohibition**

Rather than trying to prevent AI use (impossible and counterproductive), we teach students to use AI openly, critically, and ethically. This prepares them for professional practice where AI tools are standard across all business disciplines.

**3. Start Small, Scale Gradually**

You don't need to revolutionize your entire curriculum overnight. Start with one prompt, one assignment, one semester. Build confidence and capability progressively.

# Acknowledgments

This booklet synthesizes ideas from multiple sources:

- Prompt engineering techniques adapted for professional education contexts
- Curtin University program information and learning outcomes
- Pedagogical frameworks from experiential learning, reflective practice, and authentic assessment
- Professional practice standards and ethical guidelines across business disciplines
- Emerging research on AI in higher education

The goal is not to be cutting-edge or technically impressive. The goal is to help business educators do their work better—prepare confident, competent, ethical professionals for complex workplaces.

# Important Notes

## Technology Changes Rapidly

AI tools evolve quickly. Specific platform names (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) and capabilities described here reflect the state of technology in early 2025. The principles and pedagogical approaches remain relevant even as specific tools change.

## Context Matters

This booklet was developed for Curtin University's business programs. If you're at a different institution or teaching a different discipline, you'll need to adapt examples, learning outcomes, and institutional references. The frameworks are transferable; the specifics may not be.

## This Is a Starting Point

Consider this booklet a foundation, not a complete solution. You'll discover what works for your students, your teaching style, and your context through experimentation. The appendices provide templates you can adapt and build upon.

# Getting Help and Providing Feedback

As you implement ideas from this booklet, you may have questions, encounter challenges, or discover innovative applications we didn't consider.

**For Curtin staff:**
- Contact your Faculty Teaching and Learning team for pedagogical support
- Consult with IT Services for technical access and troubleshooting
- Connect with colleagues who are experimenting with AI integration
- Consider forming a learning community around AI-enhanced teaching

**For others:**
- Adapt frameworks to your institutional context
- Share successes and failures with your teaching and learning community
- Contribute to the growing body of practice around AI in education

# A Personal Note to Readers

If you're feeling skeptical about AI in education, that's healthy. Technology is not inherently good or bad—it's how we use it that matters.

If you're worried this is too technical, I promise it's not. If you can write an email, you can write an AI prompt.

If you're concerned about losing control of your teaching, you won't. You'll gain new capabilities while maintaining your pedagogical judgment and professional expertise.

The goal of this booklet is simple: **by the end, you should feel excited and equipped to try one new thing in your next class.**

That's it. One simulation. One new assessment approach. One conversation where a student gets to practice being a business professional in a safe environment before they face real workplace challenges.

Because ultimately, that's what we're here for.

Let's begin.
