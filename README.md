# AI as a Teaching Partner: Practical Applications for Multidisciplinary Business Education

A comprehensive guide for educators integrating AI into teaching across business disciplines including HR, marketing, accounting, management, supply chain, information systems, tourism & hospitality, and economics.

## Overview

- **Flight Simulator Learning**: Safe practice environments where students can learn from AI feedback without stakes
- **Process-Based Assessment**: Evaluating how students think, not just what they produce
- **Transparent AI Use**: Making AI use explicit and building critical engagement skills
- **Discipline-Specific Applications**: Real examples from 8+ business disciplines

## Key Concepts

### Flight Simulator Learning
AI conversations can function like flight simulators—allowing students to practice complex professional scenarios repeatedly with immediate, realistic feedback, without the stakes of real situations.

### Transparent AI Use
Rather than prohibiting AI, the approach makes AI use explicit:
- Students use AI openly in assignments
- They must show their thinking process
- They critique and verify AI outputs
- They're assessed on their judgment, not the AI's output

### Process-Based Assessment
Shift evaluation from "what did the AI produce?" to:
- What was the quality of the prompt?
- How did the student evaluate the response?
- What judgment did they apply?
- How did they improve the output?

### Discipline-Specific Pedagogy
Each business discipline has unique AI applications:
- **HR**: Scenario simulation, policy development, stakeholder communication
- **Marketing**: Campaign strategy, customer analysis, content optimization
- **Accounting**: Audit findings, compliance communication, financial analysis
- **Management**: Change management, organisational design, stakeholder engagement
- **Supply Chain**: Vendor negotiation, crisis response, process optimization
- **IT/IS**: Requirements gathering, system documentation, change management
- **Tourism & Hospitality**: Service recovery, guest relations, revenue optimization
- **Economics**: Data analysis, policy analysis, trend interpretation

## Using This Book

### For Individual Educators
1. Read Chapter 1 to understand the pedagogical approach
2. Choose one application from your discipline
3. Try one small experiment (Chapter 2 has easy starting points)
4. Adapt a prompt from the Prompt Library for your teaching
5. Gradually expand based on student feedback

### For Program Curriculum Teams
1. Review learning outcomes alignment (Appendix C)
2. Map AI applications across the full program
3. Develop shared prompts and scenarios
4. Create consistency in how AI is used across units
5. Establish academic integrity policies informed by Chapter 8

### For Faculty Development
Use Appendix B (Workshop Guide) for colleague training that:
- Builds understanding of the pedagogical approach
- Demonstrates practical implementations
- Addresses concerns and misconceptions
- Provides hands-on practice with prompts

### For Institutional Leaders
- Chapter 1 outlines the strategic rationale
- Appendix C shows alignment with institutional priorities
- Evidence of pedagogical effectiveness (throughout book)
- Implementation timeline and resource requirements (Chapter 3)

## Core Pedagogical Principles

1. **AI as Scaffolding** - AI supports learning through meaningful challenge, not by removing effort
2. **Transparency Over Prohibition** - Open AI use builds better practices than hidden use
3. **Process Over Output** - Assess how students think, not what AI produces
4. **Authentic Practice** - Simulations match professional reality
5. **Critical Engagement** - Students learn to evaluate and improve AI outputs
6. **Discipline-Specific Context** - Applications reflect how professionals actually work
7. **Gradual Sophistication** - Start simple, add complexity progressively

## Customization Guide

### For a Specific Discipline

1. Update `_quarto.yml` title to include your discipline
2. In each chapter, emphasize your discipline's tabs when creating examples
3. Add discipline-specific learning outcomes to Chapter 1
4. Customize Chapter 11 (Unit Design) with your program's structure
5. Update Appendix C with your institution's alignment

### For a Different Institution

1. Search for "Curtin" and replace with your institution name
2. Update Appendix C learning outcomes to match your program
3. Modify Chapter 3 implementation timeline if needed
4. Update any institutional policy references
5. Adjust examples to match your local context

### For Advanced Users

Appendix D (Advanced Prompt Engineering) provides techniques for:
- Creating consistent persona definitions
- Managing complex conversational contexts
- Implementing quality control mechanisms
- Building sophisticated assessment templates
- Generating discipline-specific educational materials

## Building AI Skills in Students

The book develops three levels of AI competency:

**Level 1: Basic Use**
- Chapters 2-3 teach using AI to practice and explore
- Students use simple prompts with basic feedback loops

**Level 2: Strategic Use**
- Chapters 4-7 teach prompting techniques and critical evaluation
- Students craft sophisticated prompts and evaluate outputs

**Level 3: Professional Integration**
- Chapters 8-13 show how professionals integrate AI into work
- Students apply AI responsibly in authentic scenarios

## Implementation Timeline

### Week 1: Foundation
- Read Chapter 1 (understanding)
- Review your discipline's examples throughout

### Week 2: First Application
- Choose one small experiment from Chapter 2
- Try a prompt from the Prompt Library

### Week 3-4: Expansion
- Add second application
- Gather student feedback
- Refine approach based on results

### Month 2-3: Integration
- Implement across a unit (Chapter 11)
- Develop shared resources with colleagues
- Address academic integrity questions (Chapter 8)

### Ongoing
- Scale to more units
- Measure impact on learning outcomes
- Share innovations with professional bodies

## Academic Integrity Approach

Rather than trying to detect and prevent AI use, this book teaches:

1. **Transparent Use** - Students declare AI use explicitly
2. **Critical Engagement** - Students verify and improve AI outputs
3. **Process Evidence** - Students show their thinking in transcripts/logs
4. **Professional Ethics** - Students learn how professionals use AI responsibly
5. **Institutional Alignment** - Policies support learning, not punishment

See Chapter 8 and Appendix C for full guidance.

## Prompt Library

Over 100 ready-to-use prompts organised by:
- Application type (simulation, assessment, content creation, etc.)
- Discipline (8 business fields)
- Complexity level (beginner to advanced)
- Chapter reference (where to use in curriculum)

All prompts can be adapted to your specific context—simply adjust the discipline, scenario details, or role descriptions.
