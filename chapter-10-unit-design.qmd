# Chapter 10: Designing an AI-Integrated Unit

## Beyond Individual Assignments: Whole-Unit Design

The previous chapters showed you how to create individual AI-enhanced assignments. But the real power of AI in education emerges when you design an entire unit—a complete semester's learning—with AI integration from the start.

This isn't about "adding AI" to an existing unit. It's about **redesigning with AI as a pedagogical partner**, creating learning experiences that weren't previously possible.

This chapter walks through complete unit design using backwards design principles, showing you how to scaffold student learning from "first encounter with AI" to "competent professional use."

---

## The Backwards Design Approach

### Step 1: Define Learning Outcomes (AI-Neutral)

Start here, always. What should students be able to do by the end of the unit?

**Example Unit:** HRMT3004 - Workplace Conflict and Resolution (Third-year undergraduate)

**Learning Outcomes:**
1. Analyse workplace conflicts using conflict resolution theory and organisational justice frameworks
2. Conduct fair, impartial investigations of workplace complaints
3. Demonstrate effective communication in difficult conversations (de-escalation, active listening, empathy)
4. Design and facilitate conflict resolution interventions appropriate to context
5. Apply relevant employment law and procedural fairness principles
6. Reflect critically on own practice and identify areas for development

**Note:** These outcomes don't mention AI. They describe professional competencies. AI is the *means*, not the *end*.

---

### Step 2: Design Assessments (How Will Students Demonstrate Mastery?)

Using the process-based assessment principles from Chapter 7, design assessments that make professional competence visible.

**Assessment 1: Investigation Interview Simulation (25%)**
- **What:** Students conduct simulated investigation interview with AI persona, submit transcript + process audit
- **Assesses:** Learning outcomes 2, 3, 5, 6
- **Due:** Week 6 (mid-semester)
- **Why this timing:** Gives students foundational practice before more complex work

**Assessment 2: Conflict Resolution Portfolio (40%)**
- **What:** Students design intervention for multi-stakeholder conflict, conduct simulated mediation/facilitation, write reflective analysis
- **Assesses:** Learning outcomes 1, 3, 4, 6
- **Due:** Week 11
- **Why this timing:** Builds on skills from Assessment 1, integrates theory from mid-semester content

**Assessment 3: Research Essay (Critical Analysis) (35%)**
- **What:** Critical analysis of conflict resolution approaches in specific organisational contexts (e.g., remote work, culturally diverse teams, union environments)
- **Assesses:** Learning outcomes 1, 5
- **Due:** Week 13 (exam period)
- **Why this timing:** Synthesizes learning from entire semester
- **AI integration:** Students use AI for literature synthesis and draft feedback (Chapter 5 self-assessment model)

---

### Step 3: Map Learning Activities (How Will Students Prepare for Assessments?)

Now design the week-by-week learning journey that scaffolds students from novice to competent.

**Key principle:** Gradually increase complexity of AI interaction while building skill.

## The Scaffolding Progression Model

Notice how AI integration increases in complexity:

| Week | AI Complexity | Student Agency | Stakes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1-2 | Observation, simple prompts | Low (following instructions) | None (ungraded) |
| 3-4 | Single persona, structured scenarios | Medium (some choice in approach) | Low (formative) |
| 5-6 | Graded simulation, self-assessment | High (must plan and execute) | Medium (25% of grade) |
| 7-9 | Multi-persona, ethical critique | High (designing interventions) | Preparation for high-stakes |
| 10-11 | Complex portfolio with multiple components | Very high (strategic choices) | High (40% of grade) |
| 12-13 | AI as research assistant | Very high (independent work) | High (35% of grade) |

**This progression develops:**
1. **Technical comfort** (Weeks 1-2)
2. **Basic AI literacy** (Weeks 3-4)
3. **Applied competence** (Weeks 5-8)
4. **Critical oversight** (Weeks 9-11)
5. **Independent professional use** (Weeks 12-13)

---

## Balancing AI and Non-AI Activities

**Important:** Not everything should involve AI.

### This unit includes traditional elements:

- **Lectures:** Content delivery (theory, legal frameworks, research findings)
- **Workshops:** Peer discussion, case analysis, group problem-solving
- **Readings:** Textbook chapters, journal articles, policy documents
- **Live role-play:** At least 1-2 in-person practice sessions for social learning
- **Guest speaker:** Practicing mediator or workplace investigator
- **Reflective journaling:** Weekly reflections on learning (not AI-assessed)

### The 60/40 rule:

Aim for approximately:
- **60% traditional teaching and learning activities**
- **40% AI-enhanced activities**

This ensures students develop both technological proficiency and traditional professional skills (working with humans, not just chatbots).

---

## Supporting Student AI Literacy Development

Across the semester, explicitly teach AI literacy:

### Week 1: What AI Is (and Isn't)
- AI as pattern generator, not intelligence
- Strengths and limitations
- When to trust vs. verify

### Week 4: Prompt Engineering
- How to write effective prompts
- Troubleshooting poor responses
- Iterating to improve results

### Week 7: Critical Evaluation
- How to spot AI errors
- When AI oversimplifies
- Recognizing bias in AI outputs

### Week 9: Professional Ethics
- Accountability when using AI tools
- When to use AI vs. when human judgment is essential
- Transparent vs. hidden AI use

By semester's end, students haven't just used AI—they've developed **AI literacy as a professional competency**.

---

## Common Design Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: "AI for AI's Sake"
**Problem:** Including AI because it's trendy, not because it serves learning outcomes.
**Solution:** Every AI activity must clearly connect to a learning outcome. If you can't justify it pedagogically, remove it.

### Mistake 2: All or Nothing
**Problem:** Either avoiding AI entirely or making everything AI-based.
**Solution:** Balance. Use AI where it adds value (simulation, feedback, practice) and traditional methods where they're superior (peer learning, live practice, social skills).

### Mistake 3: Assuming Technical Competence
**Problem:** Expecting students to figure out AI tools independently.
**Solution:** Explicitly teach prompt writing, troubleshooting, critical evaluation. Scaffold technical skills just like you scaffold content knowledge.

### Mistake 4: No Progression
**Problem:** Same level of AI complexity all semester.
**Solution:** Design deliberate progression from simple to complex, guided to independent, low-stakes to high-stakes.

### Mistake 5: Ignoring Equity
**Problem:** Assuming all students have equal access to AI tools, devices, internet.
**Solution:** Provide alternatives (lab access, in-class time for AI activities), use university-subscribed tools where possible, ensure core learning is accessible without premium AI access.

## Aligning Unit Design with Program Goals

Your unit doesn't exist in isolation—it's part of a degree program.

### Consider:

**Vertical integration:**
- What AI skills do students bring from earlier units?
- What AI competencies will later units assume?
- How does your unit scaffold toward program-level AI literacy?

**Horizontal integration:**
- What other units are students taking concurrently?
- Could you coordinate AI activities across multiple units?
- Are there opportunities for cross-unit projects?

**Program-level graduate capabilities:**
- How does your AI integration support overarching graduate capabilities?
- Communication? Critical thinking? Professional practice? Technological proficiency?

---

## Communicating the Design to Students

Students need to understand the pedagogical design—it helps them engage meaningfully.

### First lecture (explain the approach):

> "This unit uses AI tools as part of your learning. Here's why:
>
> In your HR careers, you'll use AI for data analysis, policy drafting, and decision support. Our job is to prepare you to use those tools competently and ethically.
>
> You'll notice the AI activities progress across the semester:
> - Early weeks: You'll practice basic skills in safe, low-stakes environments
> - Mid-semester: You'll apply those skills in realistic scenarios for assessment
> - Late semester: You'll use AI independently as a professional tool
>
> By the end, you'll have practiced difficult conversations dozens of times—something that would be impossible without AI. You'll also know when to trust AI, when to question it, and when human judgment must override technology.
>
> This isn't about making your degree easier. It's about preparing you for professional practice in an AI-augmented world."

### In your unit outline (be explicit):

Include a section titled **"AI Integration in This Unit"** that explains:
- Why AI is used
- How it supports learning outcomes
- What skills students will develop
- Expectations for academic integrity
- Support available

---

## Evaluating Your AI-Integrated Unit

After the semester, evaluate systematically:

### Student learning evidence:
- Did assessment results improve compared to previous semesters?
- Did students demonstrate competencies that previous cohorts struggled with?
- What does student work reveal about their AI literacy development?

### Student feedback:
- Survey: How useful was AI for your learning? (1-5 scale)
- What AI activities were most valuable?
- What AI activities felt like "busy work"?
- Do you feel more prepared for professional practice?

### Your experience:
- Did AI integration save or cost you time overall?
- What worked better than expected? Worse?
- What would you change next semester?
- What would you keep?

### Iterate and refine based on evidence.

## Your Action Step

Design (or redesign) one unit using this backwards design approach:

1. **Choose a unit** you teach (or will teach)
2. **Define learning outcomes** (without mentioning AI)
3. **Design assessments** that make competence visible
4. **Map 12-week learning journey** with deliberate AI scaffolding
5. **Check balance** (60% traditional, 40% AI-enhanced)
6. **Plan equity supports** (access, alternatives, scaffolding)

Don't aim for perfection—aim for "better than what I'm currently doing."

You can refine each semester based on what you learn.

---

**Next Chapter Preview:** In Chapter 11, we shift focus to postgraduate students and research contexts. You'll learn how to use AI as a research assistant—for literature review, data analysis, research question development, and critical synthesis—while maintaining academic rigor and original thinking. This is particularly relevant for MCom students and thesis supervision.
